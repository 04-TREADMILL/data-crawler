The cups package is included in the default Ubuntu manifest, so it should not be listed under requirements.

505|Started to work on one tonight. I'm not at all happy with it yet, but maybe it's a start. https://github.com/FabianLauer/vs-code-xml-format
506|There are also some other discrepancies with the current [W3C working draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-css3-values-20120308/), `Hz` and `kHz` frequency unit capitalization, the `dppx` resolution unit is missing and so is the `turn` angle unit. These are all present in the [latest spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/). Should these be added/amended too?

508|@tyriar I was planning to look at the others as part of another PR
509|@dstorey :+1:
510|I believe this is the same issue as #160. Check that post and downgrade will be the best choice so far.
511|Unfortunately I can't compare it with any older version. I installed it today and fiddled a bit with for a bit, until the font's bluriness became too much of a displeasure. (on Win 7, 100 percent DPI)  The question that I really want to ask here is this:  ![f](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4998498/11274683/3350697c-8eda-11e5-8797-806278ef6e93.png)  This picture _(the top one from the original post)_ - **is this how the font should look like?** Because it looks too blurry for me, too. Less than in the second one, but still.
512|"You joined GitHub only to say that? You literally joined less than two hours ago and first thing you said is this???  I want to point out: Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 isn't ""Requirement"". It's ""has been tested"" on it. Actual requirements for Linux-based OS distribution are noted as minimal versions of libc and libc++ . This is all.  Developers haven't pointed that Ubuntu 14.04 is only supported distribution. They said ""Generic Linux"". And provide 32 and 64 bit binaries. When Visual Studio Code doesn't work in other distros due to lack of CUPS or Wayland or some other library like nette or gconf, that's a bug. Of either documentation or Visual Studio Code. If I was a maniac who tried to use VS Code in beautifully hand-crafted LFS or in container to prevent telemetry, this information would have been useful to know and not to try to find it manually. As I ran headlong into one problem, I feel that it's my duty to report said problem."
513|"I have a similar issue. Search is extremely slow and gets stuck at some point. I have around 33K files, mostly source code.   A few results are being shown after a while but this is clearly incomplete.   Sublime Text (or even the ""findstr"" command) have no trouble grepping though these files in a few seconds.   I am using a fast SSD as a disk-level storage (Samsung 840 PRO) so disk read performance should be very good both in terms of IOPS and bandwidth."
514|Ok, I missed issue with this problem, see #245

516|This may be related to issue #179
517|"I got another freeze trying out a few things in a markdown file. I decided to try to reproduce the error and I did make a bit of progress but not much yet.  Here is what's working so far:  I created a new .php file with the following content:  ``` php <?php echo ""asd"";  echo ""asd"" echo ""asd""; ?> ```  The empty line and the missing semicolon are on purpose. I open the file and then open the editor's development console and switch to the ""console"" tab. All I need to do now is go to the blank line and enter a function name, for example `fopen()`. As soon as I type the opening bracket you'll see the `[Plugin Host] provideSignatureHelp` console entry followed by the object containing the corresponding help text. So far so good, however, every now and then when I use an invalid function name I don't get the `[Plugin Host] no entry` console output but instead I don't get anything at all. What follows are those two warnings the next time I hover over a function or press ctrl+space to open the autocomplete hints:  `WARNING: Promise with no error callback:undefined` `Error: Promise did not implement oncancel(...)`  Unfortunately I don't have the line numbers right now because I un-minified the workbench.main.js file. However, the two log entries are printed by this code block:  ``` javascript define(""vs/base/common/winjs.base"", [""./winjs.base.raw"", ""vs/base/common/errors""], function(e, t) {     ""use strict"";      function n(e) {         var n = e.detail,             r = n.id;         return n.parent ? void(n.handler && o && delete o[r]) : (o[r] = n, void(1 === Object.keys(o).length && setTimeout(function() {             var e = o;             o = {}, Object.keys(e).forEach(function(n) {                 var r = e[n];                 r.exception ? t.onUnexpectedError(r.exception) : r.error && t.onUnexpectedError(r.error), console.log(""WARNING: Promise with no error callback:"" + r.id), console.log(r), r.exception && console.log(r.exception.stack)             })         }, 0)))     } ```  From that point on the whole autocomplete/suggestion system acts completely crazy. Most of the time it won't show anything at all but a simple `Loading...` (and it never goes back to the desired behavior) and sometimes the editor will just freeze. The time between the errors and the editor freezing seems to be random.  Unfortunately it's not really 100% reproducible (I get it to freeze in 3 out of 10 tries or so).  Also, since I am just seeing that issue #266 has been referenced here as well. I also noticed that pasting lots of code (I copied a few hundred lines of simple `php echo ""asd"";` lines) seems to work as well sometimes although that might just be a coincidence. At least I wasn't really able to properly reproduce anything."
518|I usually right click on the subfolder and use `Find in Folder` option. This will populate the `files to include` text box with the path prefix of the sub-folder. Search will then only return results for that subfolder.
519|@riquito autocomplete seems to be rather broken in php in general in this build, either not giving any hints at all or even completely freezing, see issue #160
520|"You can actually do this, it's just not very discoverable. Bring up the find in files dialog and pretty the small 3 dot ""button"" on the bottom right of the text box. This is how you bring up the files to include text box manually. I think it's a valid issue though, it should be made more discoverable/accessible."
521|+1  Would it be possible to add tabs through a custom extension? I quickly looked at the docs but didn't seem possible to add that type of functionality with the current API
522|There is a simple extension in the marketplace to help: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/chrisdias.vscodeZoom  I'll close this for now - reopen if it does not meet your needs.
523|@aeschli No worries, thanks for the update!

536|I created https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs/pull/46 in the docs to improve the script to allow you to continue using the terminal that spawned vscode.
537|Happens for me - the debugger seems to be launching before the pre-launch task completes. Was working fine in 0.9.
538|"@Enet4 No, there can be distro dependant packages and there can be install scripts, I am not a unix wizard that's why my script is crude, but it does suit my purpose though. Every major software for linux has a install script, or at least they provide a way to install them via shell commands ( see https://golang.org/doc/install). The thing about packaging is that someone has to build packages and that becomes a problem as the editor will get updates. Instead of that when someone wants to build from source and not have anything to do with the package, they use the install script.  I do not understand why everyone here is so against making a script, of course you can't merge my script, but it can serve as a starting point. I do not believe you both are active linux users I mean the desktop not linux servers, had you used linux and installed things from the command line you'd have understood the great convenience of having an install script, because you not only.  I believe the problem of ""outdated"" packages comes with node.js  Also apart from the user's convenience, if we provide a install script then you give the user a good user experience, and it is good that they won't have to rely on someone to package this to others because this is such a beautiful IDE! Why doesn't this project want to be in control of the complete end to end user experience for linux? It feels like linux is being ignored here."

554|I'm not sure this matters. CSS isn’t case-senstivie, and keeping everything lower-case can reduce file size (a little) when gzipping.
555|I just got the same issue. in the previous version (0.9.1), when I was writing Python scripts, the word completion works fine, though it is textual. But now the functionality is gone. I tried to reinstall it, but nothing changed. Hope can recover this function soon. Thanks:)
556|@dstorey It does actually mention in the spec that the lower case alternative is fine. But doesn't this fuel the intellisense? Feels sloppy to suggest the non-recommended capitalization when the spec and reference docs use the capitalized version.
