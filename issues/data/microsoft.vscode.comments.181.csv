18001|Does it repro after you redownload it? Are you installing it in a custom directory?
18002|@alexandrudima maybe you could give me some feedback on https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/5432/commits/eebd22d93e82aa03e635e74ae8134d8159c8905b  The motivation is to be able to provide an array of keywords when registering an editor action so that we have means to find the action in the command palette in addition to the label of the action. We can then pass in english (non translated) words to fix https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4679
18003|@bpasero Hm, very strange. I wonder how I ended up with that character. Sorry, I didn't realize this while debugging.
18004|@jrieken we do not have a task service when we have a no folder workspace. However in that case debug is also disabled, though debug service gets registered. So debug is not prepared for not having a task service, but in practice that never happens becuase they both get disabled for those cases. Let me know if there is something I should improve here.
18005|@aeschli no worries, I found some spare slashes on my desktop, attaching here: / / / /  :]
18006|The fact that we still use a global flag `enableTasks` is bad debt from old times that we need to get rid of.
18007|@chrisdias: It would be, but it is not now, i.e. a wish.
18008|We have changed our indentation behavior in the latest release, closing as dup of #5276 and you can see the explanation and workaround there
18009|"BTW, the regex is now `^(?:[\/\\]|[^\/\\]+[\/\\]|[\/\\][^\/\\]+)*?bower\.json$` which looks rather complicated. It seems to work but runs in a timeout on a long content (I tried with the default content of http://regexr.com/)  So its a ('separator' or 'everything but a separator followed by a separator' or a 'separator followed by a everything but a separator') repeated and optional. A very complicated way of saying `/bower\.json$/`"
18010|@joaomoreno I'll grab the plist from before the workaround from my backup when I'm back home.
18011|"Our current indentation was designed to help convert to only one type of indentation, more details about this can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3259).

18019|Should we merge #3192 into this issue? It should be done at the same time both menu and context menu
18020|Agree that the flag should disappear. I already did that for the configure action which shows a message when invoked on a single file. We can do the same for the clean, build and test actions. Then we can always register a task server. I can look into this.

18034|Right, sorry I somehow forgot about that!
18035|I can't reproduce this. What is the case is that changing the value requires a restart. This is stated in the file. Please be aware that you really need to close VSCode and restart it. Reloading the Window is not enough.  @akq can you please attach a video showing what you are seeing.
18036|Closing this issue, the problem must have occurred during the update to 1.0.0. I solve it by copying my code to a new file and then formatting seemed to work just fine.

18056|@edumunoz that is strange, the Load More Stack Frames action should not appear if an adapter is not implementing it. What does the C++ adapter return for the stackTrace request [total frames](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/debug/common/debugProtocol.d.ts#L397) attribute. If the adapter does not support this the action [should not be shown](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/debug/browser/debugViewer.ts#L229) at all.  In short, if the adapter does not support this it should not return the `totalFrames`. If the C++ does not return `totalFrames` attribute and this action still appears then it a bug on the vscode side and I will investigate deeper.

18081|Can't show `...` since this is a placeholder text. Tooltip can work though.
18082|I don't understand what you mean by _unstaged files_. Git doesn't talk about files, but changes. There are three types of changes: modification, addition and deletion. Then, each change can either be staged or unstaged. Here are the combinations: - unstaged modification - unstaged addition (untracked) - unstaged deletion - staged modification - staged addition - staged deletion  We currently display the **unstaged** separate from the **staged** changes. Note that the **staged** group will only show up once you actually stage something. Try clicking the **plus** sign on the right of a change. This will stage it.  What would you prefer having instead?  By the way, you can multi-select changes and use the context actions or the context menu to perform the same action on a group of changes.
