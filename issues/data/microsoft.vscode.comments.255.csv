25401|@alexandrudima This could be a duplicate of #2908, if that question is answered positively.
25402|@Tyriar ok, sounds like a plan, I'll work on that
25403|Hey guys,  This PR contains a bunch of really nice improvements to the TextMate syntax definition for PowerShell.  @gravejester originally made these changes over at the PowerShell team's new repo to centralize development on our TextMate grammar:  https://github.com/PowerShell/EditorSyntax  I noticed that the Travis CI build failed due to a colorization test that failed due to these changes.  Can you tell us where those tests are and how to run them so that @gravejester can fix as part of the PR?  Thanks!
25404|`~/.vscode-insiders` - `drwxr-xr-x  7 myusername` `~/Library/Application Support/Code - Insiders` - `drwx------  10 myusername`  I tried removing both of those folders and reinstalling an insiders build from a couple of days ago and it still won't update.
25405|/cc @aeschli
25406|@bpasero no I do not have a .git folder in my home directory.  I think code recursively loads the directory and if you happen to have a lot of files, etc it causes an OOM error.  Is my guess.
25407|@Tyriar this is to reveal the file **in the errors view** not the explorer.  Separate setting makes sense to me. `problems.autoReveal`, `boolean`.
25408|@Tyriar about size, we need to include things in which are not part of the core os which is the common dependency for everything. This could be much smaller but isn't yet as I haven't trimmed down all of it yet.  I'll get to the other items as soon as I look at it. I also based out of `release/1.0.0` which I guess the intenton is to get this into master/devel instead?
25409|@joaomoreno No, there is no pending changes in the git view. That is the same for both 1.2.0 and 1.1.1.  I clicked into the git view in both version and all I see is empty penal with a moving blue line on top.  The /Volumes/HD2/JS/Documents/code/JSDS/Test/angularjs2/qs is not configured with git, no .git dir within the folder.  ![screen shot 2016-06-10 at 10 59 04](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3171920/15968624/938fcd6c-2efa-11e6-8572-86206a21e111.png)
25410|I shouldn't be working when I'm this tired. I was using vscode 1.2 and the shortcuts I fixed here were working fine so I throught I messed up and proceeded to close the pull request. Seeing your message now I remembered that the reason they were working was because I had manually added them to my keybindings.json. Oh well, mistakes happen, I'm reopening the pull request

25412|I have already implemented this for Problems view.
25413|@bpasero: Not using Git, though apparently I have 2.8.0 installed. Tried disabling it and that didn't fix it apparently. It happened again within a few minutes.
25414|@calebegg can you open the chrome developer tools and hit the profile button from the profile tab to measure a bit where this time is spend?
25415|Supporting multiline or long descriptions is not trivial with current infrastructure. Firstly, I will be showing them with ellipsis.  @joaomoreno mentioned different ideas on how we can support this in trees.. Will look into them.
25416|"@Tyriar Typescript compiler is compiling all folders except node modules folder.. After updating tsconfig everything looks good  {   ""compilerOptions"": {     ""module"": ""commonjs"",     ""target"": ""es5"",     ""outDir"": ""out"",     ""noLib"": true,     ""sourceMap"": true,     ""rootDir"": "".""   },   ""exclude"": [     ""node_modules"",     "".vscode-test""   ] }"
25417|Great to know. Thanks aeschli
25418|@bmingles Would `window.showTextDocument` help here ?
25419|@joaomoreno for the shared process, @Tyriar for the terminal process
25420|FWIW I am also seeing slow downs to the point where VSC says the editor has crashed and must be restarted, starting after the 1.2.0 release. Git is enabled, and showing changes. My git status does not show any files changed other than the ones I have modified intentionally.
25421|In the `Ctrl+P` list, I use `Ctrl+Enter`. Otherwise I use `Ctrl+2` quite a lot.  @bpasero : Should there be a hover showing the keybindings?
25422|Just rerun my vagrant configuration from scratch and found out that /home/vagrant/.config/Code/User is missing too, if you never started vscode before.
25423|@tjsail33 It would be awesome if you could follow @J-Siu's steps and try to do what @alexandrudima [suggests](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7428#issuecomment-224920378), so we get more information on what goes on in your system.  Also do you get the same behaviour if you disable git, via the configuration settings?
25424|Nothing. Even uninstalled, deleted the folder out of Program Files (x86), and deleted the entire .vscode directory; re-installed as my user (which is a domain admin), and it's behaving exactly as before. Developer console is showing nothing. .vscode/extensions directory is empty.  The extensions icon continues shimmering indefinitely.
25425|@Thaina The extension API allows for providing a text document `registerTextDocumentContentProvider` and executing a command to preview that document `vscode.previewHtml`. You can then have in there arbitrary HTML that is previewed inside Code.  Please see https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/previewhtml-sample or https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/contentprovider-sample
25426|This is strange. Until we figure it out here's a workaround: install the extensions on the other machine and copy them over to the broken one.
25427|Did you restart Code after modifying the settings?

25429|"@FlorianLoch There is a ""hidden"" setting `editor.scrollBeyondLastLine` that you can set to `false`."
25430|That's what I've done; it seems to work fine that way. I'm running sfc /scannow, then will run Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth and Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RepairHealth if necessary.   I've got an issue in VisualStudio 2015 Community with Windows 10 SDK, but I don't think it is related (though I've seen weirder conflicts).  For the sake of more information, the error I receive is when I open a .xaml file in Designer view:   System.InvalidOperationException The Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) required by the XAML Designer was not correctly installed. Consider repairing your installation of either Visual Studio or the Windows SDK.  I've repaired the installation, uninstalled and re-installed, uninstalled Win10SDK and deleted directory, installed the stand-alone SDK package...I'm begining to think there's a gremlin in my system somewhere that is effecting both programs (VS and Code).
25431|Not related, but worth a try. 👍
25432|With 8fd51f85b99158addb59c0ce66ce8709e7029ccb, there is no more need to run special scripts to generate the monaco.d.ts, it will always be up-to-date in our master and the build will fail if it is not up-to-date.
25433|This issue was moved to Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage#182
25434|Thanks @Tyriar, thats great to hear!  I have experienced the horizontal scrolling issue that @TurkeyMan is reporting. Gets stuck and can't see the left hand site without closing and reopening the terminal.
25435|I implemented a base action that toggles the focus just like ToggleViewletAction  https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/browser/panel.ts
25436|You would write an extension like this one: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/configuration-editing/src/extension.ts That one adds completion proposals to the keyboard.json file. That code uses a library called 'jsonc-parser' to find out where the cursor is and what to complete. That's where the work will be. Check out our documentation on how to scaffold an extension and how to publish it when done. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/example-hello-world
25437|Hmm, didn't i try that? :-) works great - thanks.... 👍
25438|I get this:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1809840/15973247/f8dbd866-2f07-11e6-98f4-f8b27e35c608.png)
25439|Shame on me. Please excuse me, I totally forgot that I asked here. The Problem does not occur any more.
25440|@alexandrudima Great! Thanks for the hint!
25441|@aeschli I'm sorry, but I'm not familiar with TextMate Grammer Injections.  It's just that it was stated to help resolve syntax highlight/completion of HTML inside of backticks, so I'm trying to figure out how.  Or should this issue not be closed?  I don't mind taking on some work, if you can lead me in the right direction.
25442|@alexandrudima How can I copy the results and how to copy all the groups 1 of the results?
25443|Looks like my issue was fixed, then: #7268 (That one was requesting font ligatures on the terminal)  But I agree that maybe a separate setting would be nice.
25444|@joaomoreno is this setting just inherited from the editor setting? Does it still work when turned off in editor?
25445|@sergiusens yeah if you update your work to work on master with the tweaks I mentioned then we can push this and I'll get notified if it breaks. It will also make it convenient for anyone who wants to use snappy packages from an OSS build.
25446|Thanks @doyintade, it's clear who the owner is now :smiley:
25447|Yes I restarted after each attempt. Let me know if there is anything I can post that might be helpful
25448|The resizing has been fixed already and is waiting on a new xterm version to be published. The CJK chars wrapping weirdly is this issue https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js/issues/62 - closing in favor of that.
25449|Terminal process already fixed in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7458
25450|Duplicate of https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6451
25451|@joaomoreno would you have a workaround I tried to unset `COM_GOOGLE_CHROME_FRAMEWORK_SERVICE_PROCESS/USERS/LUCNOC/LIBRARY/APPLICATION_SUPPORT/GOOGLE/CHROME_SOCKET` opening the package and editing Content/Resources/app/bin/code but I can't seem to find how to escape it. Also removed chrome...
25452|Created https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-generator-code/issues/42 to fix the problem at the yeoman generator then. Thanks.
25453|@TurkeyMan I think this may be fixed when we switched to xterm.js, if you manage to repro in insiders please comment/reopen.
25454|The terminal is planning `toggle` and `focus` commands, users are going to want a combined toggle visibility and focus which is what toggle currently is.
25455|I cannot reproduce this on 1.2.0 stable, is it consistently reproducing @ramonsan? Can you check the console in devtools to see if there are any errors (Help > Toggle Developer Tools)?

25460|@aeschli Hi, I'm new to this - does the travis-ci check fail mean I need to do something here?
25461|This issue was moved to Microsoft/vscode-go#360
25462|@coreh this would probably need to be supported in Chromium/Electron first.
25463|@gontadu I think travis is having some issues recently, the failure looks unrelated to your change.
25464|See https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7511 for testing this in a dev build
25465|Seems fixed when using master xterm.js
25466|See https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7302#issuecomment-225097257 for the proposed default keybindings used by the terminal.
25467|Hey should this be disabled by default? Or at least a bit more generous than 50 chars?
25468|I just looked it up and found this conversation on SO http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2290016/git-commit-messages-50-72-formatting  Seems like the linux kernel contributions recommend 70-75 chars max. Those guys live on the command line where these things matter so I'm guessing we can be a little more relaxed than 50 characters.
25469|@sebasijan you might use a tool such as Wireshark to analyze if the packets go through the proxy properly. If they do then I suspect your corporate proxy blocks the access to the necessary site for some reason.  The setting has been verified by far too many users, so I think this issue you report is more related to the network settings than VSCode itself.
25470|Looks like the git commit man page recommends 50 characters or less https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit.html#_discussion  I gotta go retrain myself!

25472|Actually the above has some issues: - <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd>, k and x are all taken - I was looking into chords but it's not possible to use them from within the terminal as it needs to consume the keys.
25473|https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js/issues/119
25474|@alexandrudima Just pinging you to ask about how to handle the localization stuff since this is a config key and has associated text to be shown in the config file.
25475|@Tyriar Yes, I don't think hex is bad readability. Problem is changed file which is a mixture of hex and color name. So, I think color name to hex is good too.
25476|In any place, such as the East Asian language Chinese Italic is not good, because this is the generation algorithm of the s system in italics.
25477|"@bpasero  I ran the same step on 1.1.1 again. Instead of just checking the cpu time from 'ps', I also generated the console log this time and have some interesting results.  From 1465621503942 to 1465621844639, there is a .git directory within the folder.  From 1465622014559 to 1465622018214, I renamed .git to ._git, and discovered that 1.1.1 was doing the same thing as 1.2.0.  The normal interval between ""repositoryRoot"" seems to be ~110sec base on log. I suspected that the ""repositoryRoot"" action crashed/failed when it act on my home directory (due to huge number of files), but retry right away, and become a tight loop (~30times/sec). The difference between 1.1.1 and 1.2.0 is that 1.1.1 will stop doing it after ~4sec, while 1.2.0 will go on indefinitely.  So the issue maybe due to git repository exceeding: - certain size - number of files - total length of full path of all files within repository

25479|@weinand can you confirm this behaviour makes sense over our current behaviour?  @elemongw can you point to the UX guidelines on Mac where this is stated?
25480|Good point, that can probably be changed easily.
25481|@Brakkar are you talking about the indication of the currently active line in the editor?
25482|👍
25483|@doyintade are you able to share the workspace with me and give me further instructions how to replicate your setup on my machine?
25484|Problem solved switching back to Webstorm Jetbrain. Unfortunately as some of my projects reach 30k lines and hundreds of classes VSC is no longer productive. Too many lacking basic features. Will try again in 6 months or so to see if the product matures.  -- R
25485|-1 for doing this for the output because there is really no use case for putting focus into the output panel. I often use Cmd+Shift+U to quickly bring in the output to see for compile errors and then want to dismiss it again.
25486|@bpasero no, the active line in command palette (as shown on attached image) and file explorer. It should be the same color as the one we set in the editor, or it should have a setting on its own.  Currently, as shown on the photo I attached, it's almost invisible.
25487|Ok, I am not doing anything specific, those are the default tree colors.
25488|If you look at the editor from a metre away, the only thing you will see is the deeply saturated status bar, which is actually pretty distracting while editing.   Since  #1231 is now closed, it would be nice to have a option to tone it down a bit.
25489|But can't a custom color be implemented for this ? Or at least make it match the editor select line color that we can already set ? tks
25490|Excerpt from the [OS X HIG](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/Dock.html)  > If the app is running when the user clicks its Dock icon, the app becomes active and all open unminimized windows are brought to the front; minimized document windows remain in the Dock. If there are no unminimized windows, the last minimized window should be expanded and made active. If no windows are open, the app should open a new window—a new untitled window for document-based apps, otherwise the main app window.  This rule is universally followed, even from apps that don't extensively follow the HIG
25491|@Tyriar actually my previous comment on <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>backspace</kbd> does apply. In native powershell the sequence deletes whole words, in powershell in the integrated terminal it only deletes single characters, the same as unmodified <kbd>backspace</kbd>. This is both on 1.2.0 and the 2016-6-10 Insider release.
25492|@bpasero yes, this makes sense.
25493|We have to do this so that you do not loose your unsaved work in the editor.

25496|Hi, I have similar issue if I try to remote debug (Node+TS running at Ubuntu) at Windows VSC v1.2.0. When I set break point at TS code, Break point moves to the above position. I've tested it with the sample codes from Typescrpt offical web site. Just FYI, I've attached the screen below: ![ts remote debug moves break point](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8456612/15984998/76eb7e4a-3021-11e6-8f68-169343532c6c.png)  If it works, I only need headless Ubuntu server and I can do all code work at Windows (again!!!). Could you please push it up on the priority list?  Thanks, Jin.
25497|@troplin we have received some reports on this issue already and have some advice and questions: - can you please let us know if this reproduces in Code 1.1 already (download from: https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/def9e32467ad6e4f48787d38caf190acbfee5880/VSCode-darwin-stable-unsigned.zip) - can you verify this is git by quickly disabling git from settings (`git.enabled` and a restart of Code) - do you happen to have a `.git` folder somewhere in the parent chain of the folder you are opening?  Thanks!
25498|1. Will try the old version later, but I just updated to 1.2 and I think I would have noticed if it behaved like this before. 2. Yes, if I disable git it goes away. 3. Yes, the parent directory contains a `.git` folder. That's strange because this doesn't make any sense, I must have created it by accident.
25499|@jin-chong Where do you keep the source maps? Are they inlined in the generated code? If not did you verify that the source map is up to date?
25500|The orphaned `.git` directory was the culprit. I've deleted it and now everything is fine. It probably also explains the problems that I have with the mercurial plugin in Atom Editor sometimes working and sometimes not.  Thanks a lot for the hint!  Still, VS Code should not consume so much CPU. A `git status` on the parent directory is instantaneous. Do you scan the entire file tree on each file modification?
