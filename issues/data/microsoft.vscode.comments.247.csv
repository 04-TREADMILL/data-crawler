24601|On second thought suspect `registerOnTypeFormattingEditProvider` might do what I want. Will report back :rose:
24602|With regards to error-lists, showing long error messages completely would occupy space. So, I am thinking to provide an expand/collapse option for the error-entry to show or hide the complete description.
24603|"This feature helps us because I often want to use ""Add Selection"" (`Ctrl+D`) while continuing the ""Find"". When I am using ""Find"" `foo` to check whether all `foo`s were written correctly, I found incorrect `bar`. I selected `bar` and pressed `Ctrl+D`, to fix the `bar`. Then, the ""Find"" text box was changed to `bar` unintentionally. I have to type `foo` again into the ""Find"" text box to continue the checking."
24604|Is this platform dependant? Finder, in OS X, does not behave that way.
24605|I install back to 1.1.1, everything is ok.
24606|@FeaRCODE #7300
24607|@FeaRCODE Sorry, there is currently no work in the folding area planned for the coming month.
24608|@bpasero Thanks, I'll just revert the changes nevertheless. We should clean up that code since it seems to never be used!
24609|I believe this is how Windows Explorer works and it's how I generally expect tree views to work. Atom works the same as I'm describing https://github.com/atom/tree-view/issues/561 (I actually did the PR before joining :stuck_out_tongue:)
24610|My bad, I tried again and it worked. I think this was either a missing comma in my keybindings or I only reloaded the window, didn't restart vscode.
24611|@Tyriar @bgse Somehow, I can't reproduce it anymore today. Now it is just not possible to change the color theme, when terminal is in focus as in #6437. Nothing changed since yesterday. Just one reboot. Some astonishing nondeterminism going on here. :D
24612|@martinring there are a few quirky bugs I'm chasing that don't make a lot of sense (#6738), I guess this is one of them :stuck_out_tongue:
24613|Duplicate https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7062
24614|This might be caused by lack of proper locale. See #7301 for workaround.
24615|@cg-cnu try installing via the command line, I find the GUI gets a little flaky sometimes:  ``` sudo yum install <file>.rpm ```
24616|Just noticed something from a comment above:  > `Extension host terminated unexpectedly. Code: 3221225477 Signal: null`  electron/electron#3570 says that `3221225477` is a really ugly crash, as in segfault or access violation.

24618|@bpasero First of all please accept my apologize for not responding so soon, I am afraid I can't provide you with a feedback because the issue were my AMD Radeon Graphics Drivers, after an Update was released the issue was gone. Thanks for your hard work!
24619|@zeewane I've used Google Translate and here is what it translates to: Switching Developer Tools Click Mobile view Close Developer Tools Tip exception is encountered and needs to close  However, I do not understand the steps...
24620|Also, a mono-space font should be used. Otherwise whitespace based formatting won't work
24621|@bpasero fyi
24622|I am not they guy for optimise. Maybe @joaomoreno or @alexandrudima
24623|It's standard to have View: prefixed for actions in the view menu.
24624|@Tyriar did you change **all** linux builds to produce `tar.xz` files instead of `zip`? We have tools that depend on the fact that they are `zip` files.
24625|I guess doing something like how Debug does as there are a bunch of commands coming for multi terminal handling in June.  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2193314/15849436/6d1c3c2a-2c47-11e6-97ab-759374f35632.png)
24626|Duplicate of https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7062
24627|You can bind any key/keys to the `acceptSelectedSuggestion` command using the keyboard configuration story. For details see: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/keybindings#_customizing-shortcuts
24628|Yeah I see the `View:` argument... but I'd not be very happy in having: - Terminal: Open System Terminal - View: Open Integrated Terminal - Terminal: Focus Integrated Terminal
24629|@phest what language/extension are you using?
24630|"@clarkcox3 You can get this behaviour for page up and page down by editing the `keybindings.json`:  ``` { ""key"": ""pagedown"", ""command"": ""scrollPageDown"", ""when"": ""editorTextFocus"" }, { ""key"": ""pageup"", ""command"": ""scrollPageUp"", ""when"": ""editorTextFocus"" } ```  I don't think we have commands that scroll to the beginning/end of the document that you can easily bind to."
24631|@steven-qi this should definitely be added to the docs when a topic is written on the terminal, I've created https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs/issues/343 to follow it up in the eventual documentation. Thanks! :smiley:
24632|Yeah I've seen this in my Linux desktop, although never in our build machines...
24633|Are you on node 5.10?
24634|I see you confused yourself there :smile:   Maybe you should pose the question to the rest of the team in slack or something, this is how it's done now and I agree it's a bit ugly.
24635|@cg-cnu the insiders build should be available with the version number tomorrow I think :)  Closing as duplicate of https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6587
24636|Duplicate of https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6735
24637|Good idea.
24638|Cool, thanks.
24639|@jrieken Yes we can bind key by ourself. So `acceptSuggestionOnEnter` is duplicated  So I would like to have it only one for all key. And I think `acceptSuggestionOn` is far more easier to edit. So I think we should have just `acceptSuggestion` instead
24640|This might be OS X-specific, seems fine in Linux (vscode/bash left, gnome-terminal/bash right)  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2193314/15849679/96c40b10-2c48-11e6-80f7-f8753e26f2e3.png)
24641|Duplicate of https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6455, fix coming in v1.3
24642|@jrieken It works great, thanks!
24643|@joaomoreno potentially, I'll have to check. Could ./scripts/npm.sh, code.sh and/or gulp check the node version and warn on this if so?
24644|@Tyriar @martinring Same here, no repro on Win8.1, Win10 and F23.  I'd assume there is more to it than just changing the color theme, or could be completely unrelated breakage.
24645|If will soon delete editor/standalone-languages (14.7KLOC). Maybe that will help
24646|We more or less copied the toggles from Visual Studio's find widget.  @bgashler1 @stevencl thoughts?
24647|@githubhero What theme are you using? What you describe sounds like the Dark (Visual Studio) theme. If you like variable and function declaration highlighted, use the Dark+ theme.  If that's not the problem, please add a code snippet that shows the issue.
24648|When opening vscode, the file tsconfig.json is opend in vscode editor. After executing _F1 > 6282: Stat File System_ all directories of my workspace are scanned. In the command prompt where codeHelper is running no ouptput happens. After executing _F1 > 6282: Install Watchers_, file watchers for all files in the root directory are getting istalled (see attached file output_6282.zip).  Until this time there is still no output on to see in the codeHelper command prompt. But when I open a .ts  file in vscode editor _watcher notified events_ are fired for each file in project workspace until vscode hangs and has to be killed. At the same time (when opening a .ts file) codeHelper also generates output. The attached file contains the output of the 6282 console of vscode at the time after opening a ts file in editor, but before vscode hangs.

24649|"Workaround:   1) Create a file named `/usr/local/bin/bash-login` (or whatever you'd like to name it) and add the following lines to it (You might need root to create that file depending on your setup):  ``` bash #!/bin/bash bash -l ```  2) Make it executable with `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bash-login`.  3) On your VSCode user settings, set:  ``` JSON {   ""terminal.integrated.shell.linux"": ""/usr/local/bin/bash-login"" } ```  4) Profit ✨   ![](https://cldup.com/6lQPeaCwcJ.png)"
24650|After thinking again, I think its not a good idea to put owner information as part of the entry as not everybody is interested in this info. Another idea is to put it as part of the filters so that interested users can filter markers based on who generate them

All seems to work for me with a fresh install on 1.2-insiders: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6461412/15850280/73351f6e-2c97-11e6-8ed3-cb709f305129.png)  That's the Dark+ theme.

24654|"I agree with @RyanEwen. I really appriciate the open development and amount of communication, but these announcements being  part of the official ""Release Notes"" is really confusing.  Maybe this can be split up into actual release notes, and 'what we're working on right now' or something."
24655|@frogcjn what do you mean by 'Sourcemap section'?  VS Code supports source maps, including inlined source maps and inlined source.  VS Code does **not** support 'index maps' (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit?hl=en_US)
24656|@weinand ReactNative generate source map v3, with a sections property, then vscode cannot match with this kind of source map. Vscode only can debug with source code without sections. chrome supports debug with source map sections.
24657|You can get the selection `Range` with `document.getSelection().getRangeAt(0)`.  You could then extract the client rects that form it via: `range.getClientRects()`, and create a lot of absolutely positioned white divs of the right sizes with `mix-blend-mode: difference;`. That way they reverse whatever is below them.  Would also need to use `pointer-events: none` on the divs so that they don't affect the selection.
24658|@coreh if adding the `-l` arg is all there is to it then this should make it into the next release in the form of https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7266

24666|Just open the launch.json or select a launch config from the drop down menu and problem disappears.
24667|@magnasteyr thanks for trying. I created a new version of the extension that reads the content of all js and ts files. Although this usually shouldn't trigger change events it might since a read updates the last read time on Windows. So could you uninstall that last version of the 6282 extension, install the new attached version and run F1 > 6282: Read Contents with the CodeHelper running as well. Lets hope that we see file events now. Then we at least know what is happening.  [6282-0.0.1.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/302141/6282-0.0.1.zip)
24668|@cg-cnu what you linked are definitely the correct rpm packages at least in the region I'm being served in, I just downloaded both 32 and 64 bit and checked the package.json inside and it said 1.2.0.
24669|@slaveofcode xdebug is php?
24670|@coreh :smile: this will probably sit in PR for a day or 2 so land in insiders around the same time.

24671|@sandy081 sorry, I was not clear in my description. Corrected it. I was talking about the source attribute on a marker. And be aware that different markers on a file can have different source attibutes. So we can't make it part of the file name. Either we need a column or we integrate it into the message as we do in hovers (e.g [ts]. [js], ...)

24679|This should be fixed now, it happened because stable was built using some changes in vscode-distro that I wasn't expecting. I created https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7308 to follow this up in the June release so this doesn't happen in the real switch over to tar.xz.
24680|Actually the action fixes all auto-fixable problems as defined by eslint (see http://eslint.org/docs/rules/). The action is clear in the UI, but not in the command name since the name sounded very long. We will update the documentation to explain this.  There is nothing VS Code can do since the rule is not auto fixable in eslint itself. Closing the issue.
24681|The new version of 6282 extension is missing...
24682|Is it really that the case sensitive button just isn't discoverable or is it that the need to set case sensitivity is unexpected? It does seem odd to have to turn case sensitivity on when the expression explicitly specifies a case.  Perhaps we just disable the case sensitive toggle whenever the user specifies a regex pattern? Or, we do a tooltip indicating when case sensitivity is turned off whenever the user toggles regex on?

The yum installation is successful but not updating the actual files that could be the reason am seeing the old version in help menu and all the errors. I don't have the old rpm to install and try updating to the new one to test it.  This is fixed. Thanks for your time!
24687|@yortus trying this from the command line results in the following error for me:  error TS5009: Cannot find the common subdirectory path for the input files.  Interestingly I frist tried this under node version 5.10.0 and there it worked in both command line and VS Code.   Do you see the same error in the console ? ![bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1931590/15852596/e4d114fc-2ca1-11e6-84b5-4be909afc7a7.gif)
24688|"@Tyriar I'm so used to the `⌘K` shortcut to clear the terminal on Mac, that I do it automatically without thinking. And I do it a lot.  The `⌘K` combination is even recognised in the Chrome DevTools Console for clearing the output - yet another reason that I'm so used to it.  I realise I may not be alone in this, so I have a suggestion: - As per your suggestion, set the default ""Clear Terminal"" shortcut to something that won't conflict with another shortcut, especially the chord keybindings. - If the user decides to override the default shortcut with `⌘K`, make sure that VSCode does not consider that as initiation of a chord keybinding.  This way, there won't be a conflict by default, but the user can opt to lose chord keybindings when in the context of the terminal, in favour of using the well-recognised shortcut.  Would you mind to reopen the issue to make it easier to find, and to continue the discussion?"
24689|The task frameworks sets cwd to the workspace folder by default if not provided. So I don't understand why setting it explicitly makes it work. Need to investigate.
24690|Yes. At least 5 files with active change.
24691|"I'm having a similar issue. Electron Helper is taking 50-150% CPU and eating up memory. This only happened since my update to version 1.2.0. It is happening while I have a react native project open with lots of node_modules inside.  My `ps aux | grep Electron`:  ``` johngoering     13784  56.0  6.1  5044732 508708   ??

24692|Sorry, attached to the last comment.
24693|I have no problem when opening folder or crashed. It just feels lag on typing when there are some change not committed, like something blocking the cursor.
24694|Like the hover, the message part of the in-editor error display now uses the editor font.  ![screen shot 2016-06-07 at 11 32 38](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1794099/15853043/c4ca685a-2ca3-11e6-81bd-51b4a3cef1ad.png)
24695|cc @stevencl for how to handle multiline diagnostics in the error list view
24696|You tried to use this extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robinbentley.sass-indented)?
24697|Yeah, we [cut](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/editor/contrib/referenceSearch/browser/referencesModel.ts#L84) the left part of a preview to roughly eight characters and prefer word boundaries, such as `.`, `-`, whitespace etc. I see how this isn't right for css. Maybe we shouldn't use `/\b/` but a custom set of splitters
24698|I am very sorry to hear you are having issues with VS Code. I wonder if this issue is being caused by an installed extension. Can you try to run VS Code without extensions? From the command line, execute: `code --disable-extensions` and try your steps again to see if it reproduces. If you see it is an issue with the extension, please file it against the extension repository itself.
24699|I still can't see the attachement.
24700|Is it possible to rebind the keys that go with click+dragging? I searched the `keybindings.json` but can't find one for that. Trying to rebind it to just `alt` rather than `alt+shift`
