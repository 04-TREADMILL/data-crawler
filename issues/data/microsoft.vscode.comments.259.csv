25807|Depends on https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2211 actually which might end up being tricky because it involves creating dynamic keybindings.

25815|@edumunoz thanks for the PR! Sorry for the slow response I was on vacation.  Looks good overall, however I would not expose `onDidExitAdapter` in `rawDebugSession`as we already have `onDidEvent`. So in the action on you could listen on all events and if `event.event = stopped` or `event.event = terminated` or `event.event = exit` remove the brekapoint.
25816|"Can't you have a 'tabMode' and add a keybinding, something in the manner:  { ""key"": ""cmd+1"",           ""command"": ""workbench.action.focusTab"",                                      ""when"": ""inTabMode"" },"
25817|@kisstkondoros thanks for the PR!  - It makes sense to add a feature to convert indentation only in the selection - however the issue with your approach is that it can be cryptic to the user that only the selection gets changed. What would happen if a use accidently has something selected and triggers that action - there is no UI indication that only the selection is being replaced. We could change the title of the action - but then the title would be too long and ugly imho. Suggestions on how to solve this are welcome - Changing not only the beggining but every occurence - is this something standard that all other text editors support? Because if we change this then the name of the acitons need to be also changed - as that is not indentation. Indentation is by definitaiton only the start of a line.  Due to the reasons above I am rejecting this PR. Though I could be convinced otherwise. So feedback is very welcome @kisstkondoros @alexandrudima
25818|@isidorn I think as a user you would not want to specify all the keybindings but just have them available dynamically based on the opened tabs.  @alexandrudima fyi maybe you have an idea if this is possible with our keybinding story somehow?
25819|@bpasero I thought that by default they are all in `keybindings.json` and the user does not have to specify anything additionaly.
25820|Found my answer at #2041. Looks like we aren't there yet.
25821|@roblourens I like how you implemented this in the prototpye. Would you like to create a PR with your changes + plus a small adition that you only instantitate that aciton if [stepBack](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/debug/common/debugProtocol.d.ts#L567) is supported   And the label needs to be nls.localized. And it also needs to be registered as a global workbench action.
25822|@isidorn :). so how many do we put in? 100? or do people open more than 100 tabs?

25844|@roblourens your proposal for allowing to run a debug session for a non-existing debug type is problematic because you are missing out all the other contributions of the extension. In addition it would be an effort (hack) for us to implement that.  Please consider these (existing) solutions: 1. Open the debug extension in VS Code and then run the extension with F5 (or Control-F5). This will launch another VS Code windows that 'knows' the debug type (and has all the associated contributions for that type) and you can then start your debug session against a debug server safely from there. Since you do **not** have to restart the debug extension when restarting the debug server, it is not a big pain. I'm using this approach all the time now. 2. If you don't like the additional step to launch the debug extension once, you can side install your debug extension in your ~/.vscode/extensions folder. This does not have to be the final extension. Just a folder with a package.json that contributes the new type is enough.  /cc @isidorn

For eg previewing a .md file will need more context.   Regarding settings, I would go for what @dbaeumer suggested, that looks well organized.  One more question to @bpasero and @isidorn   why are the values for the conf `""explorer.openEditors.visible""` is a number and how will I know what numbers are supported and what are they matched to?"

25851|@isidorn thanks so much!  Much appreciated :smile: Super quick question (and definitely no urgency :exclamation: to answer this at all), when I was working with the build copy of vs code, and when I ran it with `./scripts/code.bat` all looked great, except I couldn't add an extension and attempting to debug a node.js app indicated that the node subsystem couldn't be found. Was I doing something wrong there?

25854|Current state: - Code is ready for merging into master (see https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7656). - We miss the editor title area contribution. This is being addressed in #3192. - The display performance is sub-par. See updates in #7066. - Toggling between source and preview using the same keyboard shortcut is limited by #6941. Current workaround is to use the `workbench.action.navigateBack` command.
25855|"The term preview is used to describe this behaviour in Visual Studio and in Sublime Text so it's not an uncommon term (Atom calls them Pending tabs). We could always rethink the way we use it for markdown files. However, if we go with pinned and unpinned tabs we could have settings like so:  ""workbench.editor.unpinnedTabs.enableInExplorer"": true, ""workbench.editor.unpinnedTabs.enableInQuickOpen"": true and anywhere else we want to enable unpinned tabs.  We should be aware though that we might have a need in the future to also support what Visual Studio calls pinned tabs - pinned tabs are positioned to the left hand side and newly opened tabs appear to the right of all pinned tabs."

25857|@weinand I'm not sure either if it's a  > VS Code bug, an Electron issue, or some platform limitation.  What troubles me is that if I open a Console on Windows and execute `${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron` it goes and executes as if I had executed `${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd`.  This has to be a VS Code misbehavior.  P.S. I don't know how hard it's to implement in `debugAdapter` a file extension check for Windows and add `.cmd` if it doesn't exists.
25858|No one knows. Nothing really uses it.  @Lichtjaeger for that you should take the `electronVersion` as reference, as each Electron version is coupled with a Node version.
25859|@robertleeplummerjr: I definitely appreciate your passion on this particular issue. There's a lot we can do to make the C# support for VS Code even better! However, the folks working on VS Code itself aren't those who would add support for ASP.NET cspoj projects. Could we continue the conversation over on the C# extension repo?  (https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode)
25860|Related to #7196
25861|Duplicate of #7196
25862|Node debug adapter is an extension which gets packed in vscode as part of our build process. So when you run vscode out of source it is missing. In order to overcome that you need to copy the node debug extension from an installed vscode (search for node-debug inside your vscode install location) to the extension folder of vscode-oss-dev\extensions (this should live in your users folder I think). Sorry for not giving the correct win paths I am currently on a mac.
25863|Visual Studio Code does not relate at all with Visual Studio 2015.
25864|Here's what it looks like using the same colour as the selection colour in the explorer: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1704059/16045157/264167b4-323f-11e6-9daa-afeb3d5c61ca.png)
25865|@JimiC but isn't this the normal command prompt behaviour of Windows? If you have a file 'foo.cmd' and type 'foo' in the command prompt, 'foo.cmd' is executed.
25866|I am not sure about adding another separator if the contrasting colour works better?
25867|We would like to optimise the design such that the file names remain glanceable for most of the time. We think that showing the file name is more important for developers than showing the name of the web page is when browsing the web.
25868|@weinand Indeed. But I suspect that Code doesn't executes the 'foo.cmd' on Windows but tries to execute 'foo' which is for `Unix` like OS. You have to tell it explicitly the `runtimeExecutable` file extension.  If I were you (and I'm not) I would have added a file extension check for Windows and add the `.cmd` if the user hasn't specified it. It's an internal handling (which you may not prefer) but improves the user experience with Code and Electron.  Though having the OS properties now kinda solves this issue.  Still the issue with using `--enable-logging` remains.

25875|@isidorn no problem, that is a perfect explanation actually!  Thanks so much!!  That'll come in handy for future code and PRs :wink: :+1:
25876|@bpasero Yah it works.. Ctrl+Tab opens Quick open and navigates to file/tab that I last opened. That makes perfect sense without tabs. But with tabs, I felt it would be more easier to navigate and use if we have similar behavior as in browsers.   Like Ctrl + Tab goes to next visible tab and Ctrl + Shift + Tab goes to previous visible tab.
25877|Cool thanks for the quick reply - no problem! 👍

25883|@bpasero Thanks for the keybindings..  My next question would be, is it possible to enable these key bindings only when tabs are enabled?
25884|I have seen this once I think and it is likely our custom scrollbar. When you are in this state again, lets dev tools that guy.
25885|@bpasero Isn't this a case for file events?
25886|@JimiC in addition to '.cmd' I would have to check for '.bat' and '.exe' and may be even more. And I would have to implement the same order for this sequence as the windows command prompt...
25887|@joaomoreno has the env propagation been changed on OS X recently?
25888|@weinand I totally understand that there is more to it than meets the eye. OS properties solves that for now.
25889|I believe so, e.g. there are already keybindings that check for config:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/16046521/04a9af5e-324d-11e6-98d8-b7a8204be1f4.png).
25890|@jrieken yeah though all the bugs I have on file events show me that they do not work in all cases ;-)
25891|Ok now I found the actions in the context menu - and I agree it makes sense that they live there. It is just me as a user I was acustomed to have those actions in the corner. And I think it will be hard for users to find these actions in their new location.  No idea how to solve this, just saying that some users might not be happy. But it is fine for now :)
25892|Actually in this case what could bite is the fact that I ignore file change events on the currently edited file for a short period because otherwise I would reload the file every time you made a modification.   @bmingles is this a possible explanation that the text content is rapidly changed after the user saved? what is the use case for the extension?
25893|You get a LOT when you enable tabs, but you cannot have everything ;). Opened https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7666 for that particular issue.
25894|"I don't think that the scope is sufficient but that the completion item will know. Think of such JS code and the cursor being inside the curly brackets. In that case it makes sense to complete on dot.  ``` js  /**  * @param {foo.ba|} a  */  function foo(a) {  } ```  A sample the other way around would be writing a number literal for which someone proposes completions. I then might not make sense to complete on dot  ``` js var n = 33.| ```  Therefore I think either the provider or the item should define if it can be completed on a completion character."
