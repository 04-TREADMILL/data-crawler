3401|My repo is GitLab CE  ``` $ git config remote.origin.url http://ISLINGIP01.scisb.isban.corp/portales-branch-locator/branch-locator-select-ui.git ```  The URL with the final slash only apears in VSCode and if i put this URL in Chrome for example return ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS  Why VSCode connect with the remote and add a final slash?
3402|I'm agree with you. If you create a language extension, then you don't need such a feature I think.  My request applies more to extend an existing language.
3403|Edit: Ignore this comment, apparently I've managed to consistently misspell mosquito quite many times... sorry for the inconvenience.
3404|Note: the error is in VSCode when I do a push or a pull in the Git feature
3405|Is there any way you can set up a repository in that same server and give me credentials to access it so I can try to repro?
3406|What you suggest we actually already do. We have some built-in schemas. The meta-schema is one of these, it's modified in that it includes descriptions.  But I'm currently working on allowing extensions to contribute schema associations and was about to remove all built-in schemas. I changed it and package the meta schema again, so we don't loose the descriptions. The right thing to do would be to write the guys that own the meta schema to add description in the schema, so everbody profits.
3407|"@jcward great repro steps - thanks! The issue is that we wrongly expect ""win"" not ""windows"" in `package.json`. So as a workaround please use ""win"" in your `package.json`. I understand this is not aligned with our docs so from now on we will support both ""win"" and ""windows"" to end the confussion - will push that in 5mins ðŸ˜Š"
3408|@egamma @dbaeumer Started to flesh out the API with a simple `source: string` property. Question is what rendering you guys prefer in  1. Editor hover on diagnostics 2. In editor error view 3. error quick pick  I guess it should always be the same? And the should it be `message (source)` or `(source) message`
3409|Works fine, installs without any apparent issues.  I see you've decided to go for 'vscode' as command instead of 'Code' or 'code', this had me confused at first but I actually like it, I've always felt that 'code' was a little ambiguous to have in my path.
3410|I don't see anything in the dev console when running with --verbose
3411|@jrieken @dbaeumer I prefer `message (source)`, since the message is the primary information and the source is auxilliary, but I might revisit my opinion based on usage :smiley_cat:   What is the source for the built-in linter for JS or TS, is it empty?
3412|Please provide an example so that we can reproduce the problem.
3413|Excellent, it's working, thanks!

3447|Thanks for the suggestion! The vscode gitter room can be found here: https://gitter.im/Microsoft/vscode.  Now, some background on why it took so long to resolve this issue. We had quite a bit of deliberation on the team as to whether or not we have a gitter room, slack channels, or nothing at all.   Here's why. Since moving to GitHub, we have been managing a large number of input channels (GitHub issues, Twitter, Stack Overflow, email, User Voice, etc.). This is great, but we want to be responsive. To do so, we are consolidating issues to the `vscode` repository and we will [encourage](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Tracking#initial-triage-done-by-the-inbox-tracker) general 'how-to' questions be posted on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode), the best place for getting high quality answers from us and from the community.  The challenge we face here is that a gitter room is another input channel that we don't have the bandwidth to participate in right now. And, at the same time, we do want to provide a place where the Community can get together and collaborate. It is actually great to see that folks have already started to collaborate and support each other there.  What this ultimately means is that the VS Code team's presence in the room will be very limited, at least for the foreseeable future. We hope the Community will use the room and have discussions, and all we ask is that valuable Q&A is done on Stack Overflow and issues are submitted into the repository.   If there is anything needing urgent attention that we miss, please feel free to mention me (@chrisdias) and I'll jump in.
3448|"+1, I ran into the same issue, even if my jsconfig.json is set to ES6: {     ""compilerOptions"": {         ""target"": ""ES6"",         ""module"": ""commonjs""     } }"
3449|"For reference the command is (is going to be) `""editor.action.expandLineSelection""`"
3450|I'm sorry, but please file this issue again in English.
3451|Thanks for your feedback, we have considered a separate organization when we opened the code at github and decided against a separate organization. We can revisit this at a later point in time. For now the convention is to prefix vscode related repositories with `vscode-`.

3453|FYI @isidorn @weinand
3454|@isdorn we already support this, can you check that we cover this in our documentation.
3455|This is currently not supported. @weinand fyi
3456|Use the 'tsd' tool to install the .d.ts file from 'definitily typed' (not nuget). `///ref` are not needed anymore when the tsconfig.json is properly configured, that is the 'typings' folder is a peer of the tsconfig.json. See the vscode-samples https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-samples.  In the future please ask questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode) using the tag `vscode`. The VS Code team and Community will answer questions there.

3461|This is https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage/issues/22
3462|Thanks for the repo access. There was definitely a problem with VS Code's credential helper.

3483|@ricmed205 which version of node are you using. There is a know problem with node not flushing stdio before the process exits which results in loosing output. There is not much VSCode can do about it since we are reading childProcess.stdout and never get the text.

Non watching tasks we prompt unless specified different in the tasks.json.
