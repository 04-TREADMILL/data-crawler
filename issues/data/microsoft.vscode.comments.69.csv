6801|Dupe and fixed.
6802|@pocesar: is your repository public so that I can try to reproduce.
6803|@TheColorRed Please try snippets: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/userdefinedsnippets

6805|@zhqiyi is this reproducible? If yes, please provide the steps so that we can reproduce the problem (and try to fix it).
6806|@bpasero Doesn't quite work so well. Eg: select a file in the explorer, focus the editor, click the root of the explorer. Feels a bit weird.  I wonder if clicking in the root of the explorer (or any tree that has space for the root) should then be a no-op...
6807|@Tyriar so are you suggesting report this to chromium issue tracker and close this issue?
6808|Hi **@friedemannsommer**, I'm your friendly neighborhood Microsoft Pull Request Bot (You can call me MSBOT).

Real humans will now evaluate your PR.     </span>  TTYL, MSBOT;
6809|btw, is there any bash command I can execute to stress out ram?
6810|@joaomoreno I see the issues too. another idea: we already decorate empty trees with the blue outline, why do we not do the same for the case of no focussed item present. Then we do not change the semantic of the tree that much and reuse the same focus indication.
6811|yes
6812|agreed
6813|@othebe In jsconfig.json you can define excludes. Often small projects bring in a lot of dependent JS code (node_modules or build & bundled stuff) which makes VS Code chew on it. Can you check that this isn't the case you? And iff can you try by excluding things?

6816|It's not just limited to C# either, I get the same thing when writing PHP, a commented line starting with // will still invoke IntelliSense when writing for example 'while', 'for' etc.
6817|@weinand  Thanks reply. Yes, it's reproducible. 1. A is a folder that was opened by VSCode  2. Then, I copy a file to A by Nemo(1.8.4) 3. Switch to VSCode, it was died(suspended animation )
6818|Specifically useful because it lets you duplicate a line without losing the contents of your clipboard!  The alternative of Ctrl+C then Ctrl+V overwrites your clipboard.
6819|It's related to this issue https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/719
6820|@huttarichard I think he's suggesting to check for possible hardware defects with your RAM or GPU, might save you from going on a wild goose chase.  Maybe this can help: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257
6821|there is now `TextEditor.viewColumn` and `window.onDidChangeTextEditorViewColumn`
6822|:+1: Required for me!
6823|JavaScript multiline strings also look as described in this bug.
6824|@btroncone I am not a Ionic expert. Is there a git repository I can clone to get a starter project.
6825|@huttarichard Either hardware defect or lack of memory would be my guess. Might be a little premature to open a Chromium bug just yet, any more information on repro steps you can get would be helpful as there isn't much to go on now.
6826|I sort of agree, though it seems a tough sell. A better solution would be to start using VS Code or VSCode or VSC as shorthand, since that seems to be the general direction comments are taking. Google will quickly catch up.

6828|I did do snippets as a final, but you can't have a snippet of `///` so I had to use text instead. However, it would be nice if either:  - The editor picked up that `///` was a saved snippet - That this doc feature was built into the editor
6829|Just checking back again on the status of this. Do you need any other help from me?
6830|Sorry, yes, the easiest way to get started would be:  1.) npm install -g ionic@beta 2.) ionic start exampleApp tabs --v2 --ts  This will give you a starter project which will allow you to reproduce the issue.  Additional documentation: http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/cli/  Thanks for your help!
6831|I suggest to report this to either Electron or node.js as these components are crashing. This would require however to have reproducible steps in a bare Electron app.
6832|@thomastaylor312 looking at the attached crash report, I wonder if the crash report is actually related to the samba issue. Could it be a crash when you are in fullscreen mode and then restore from sleep?
6833|It was closed in favor of https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/1212. Apparently it's because Electron doesn't support `~` as it isn't meant to be meaningful outside of bash. Ubuntu 12.04's open folder dialog may be returning `~` in the path which is probably what is causing the issue. Electron removed the won't fix label though so they're open to accepting the change to support it.

6839|"Such a simple search works fine of course, but when searching for anything more specific (where the search is just preceded with `""visual studio code""`) there are plenty of times you run into a conflict with a lot of the results leading to Visual Studio pages instead. Just one example I've run into out of several in the past few days alone, and it doesn't even have anything to do with ""code"": https://www.google.com/search?q=visual+studio+code+tomorrow+theme Top 3 results are all for visual studio though it isn't obvious right away, the correct result is 5 down.

6841|Addressed feedback, merging.
6842|Alright guys, not going to take more time (of yours). I'll wait until happens again. And then we can reopen this issue (with more info).... Thanks for such a great product!

6847|Looks like an issue with the tomorrow theme. This is the rule that is coloring it, nothing should be colored white on a white background:  ``` css .monaco-editor.vs.ms-vscode-Theme-TomorrowKit-themes-Tomorrow-tmTheme .token.meta.separator {     color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); } ```

6856|@bpasero our project is cross platform SDK with c++, someone code with Windows/Visual Studio, some MAC/XCode, some linux/VIM, and some text editor, most of text editor save file without BOM header. Then the project contain more than 6000 files, they have different encoding. I love vscode, but it was a nightmare if i read the coce of the project with vscode.  Then, can u speak Chinese ?
6857|@claycephas did you run a git operation when that happened (e.g. switching branches). I think the deletion of the tsconfig.json file happens as follows:  - some one tries to delete tsconfig.json. However since it is locked it fails, however to my knowledge Windows queues the delete and executes it when the lock is gone. - when VSCode ends the file will be deleted.
6858|@moostad from the message it looks like the plugin host got in trouble. Is this reproducible for you. If so, is the code some public so that we can try to reproduce this locally.  @alexandrudima does the plugin host error message ring a bell.
6859|"@alexandrudima Thanks a lot for the thorough analysis! This makes perfect sense.  Personally I don't think many people use these kind of thin bitmap fonts and I haven't noticed this rendering issue with all the other ""programming fonts"" I've tried so far. Definitely not a high priority issue in my opinion. The workaround with Arial as a backup font works fine for me. I don't mind the blurry arrow at all, with a dark color theme it's barely noticeable."

6863|"So, a few things that i've discovered. Tokenizer counts 1 cyrillic symbol as 2 symbols (maybe cause cyrillic is twice long in bytes, compared to latin symbols). So if you need to highlight `Возврат` (return in eng), vscode highlightes strLen(""Возврат"")*2 = 14 symbols."
