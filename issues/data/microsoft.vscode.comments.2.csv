101|The github issue tracker is not really the place for questions.
102|Fair enough, sorry. I was just letting them know there is already a place for feature requests.
103|"> The github issue tracker is not really the place for questions.  I disagree. The primary problem with pushing questions away from GitHub issues is there is not a clear line between ""questions"" and ""bugs"". For example, a user experiencing a problem might have simply misconfigured something on their local system, but just as easily could have found a bug that affects many people. Alternately, a bunch of repeated questions (duplicates) likely indicates a problem in the user documentation should should be addressed. GitHub issues is the place where people who are interested in participating in the project should feel comfortable participating, and never be dismissed based on something like the ""kind"" of issue they reported."

118|Thx @guillermooo, I am currently getting myself comfortable with the plugin system and typescript and hope I can contribute something soon :)
119|I believe this is because static properties, rather any class property declared this way, is an ES7 feature and code doesn't yet have support for it.  Question though, are you guys getting bracket completion when using .jsx extension? I'm not. I don't get auto indent either, so I've been using Sublime when working with React at all lately.
120|Well, it's an ES7 feature, but it doesn't highlight any errors when you use the .jsx extension.. Also, it's even highlighting the `<div>` tag so... Something is wrong :D
121|As far as I'm concerned this fix should be better support of JSX contained in `.jsx` files and an addition of the ability to select which file parsing I want to use for each filetype. And yes the ES7 features are a separate issue.
122|Fixed, thanks!
123|"You need to use the filesGlob property with a wildcard expression if you want to find all *.js files inside of your app folder.  Change your jsconfig.json to this:  ``` {     ""compilerOptions"": {         ""target"": ""ES6"",         ""module"": ""commonjs""     },     ""filesGlob"": [         ""app/**/*.js""     ] } ```"
124|@Daniel-Steiner I'm relatively certain that the [REST API support for TFVC](https://www.visualstudio.com/integrate/api/tfvc/changesets) is relatively read-only.  You'd still need to use the heavyweight SOAP API to do things like checkout and checkin changes.  You could, however, shell out to `tf` to do TFVC integration.
125|Where is this documented?
126|"Also this doesn't work. It works if I specify the full path in ""files"" but with the globbing config my file still shows pure errors."
127|+1 jsx support in .js file extensions is a required feature
128|Is anyone else not getting bracket completion and auto indent with .jsx files?
129|"for me, removing the whole ""files"" section altogether seems to cause the errors to go away, indicating that ES6 applies to the entire project.  Not sure if that helps your situation.  The filesGlob wasn't actually the fix.  (FYI, I got the filesGlob idea from tsconfig.json which is a superset of jsconfig.json, and it seemed to fix the issue, as simply removing the 'files' section fixes it for me... but then you're stuck with ES6 for your whole project)"
130|"If my jsconfig.json file is just:  ``` {     ""compilerOptions"": {         ""target"": ""ES6"",         ""module"": ""commonjs""     } } ```  It still doesn't work, my file is highlighted as syntax errors. The only thing that's worked so far is specifying the absolute file path."

136|If you were on the insiders program and were using the Auto update feature, download the app and replace in Applications and launch.

151|I am having related issues to this, and wasn't really sure how to fix it. It seems to happen a lot for new files, but if I save the file, close VS Code and reopen it, the errors go away. Editing `jsconfig.json` and saving it seems to correct the issue as well, doesn't seem to matter what changes I made the jsconfig, just that it did change.
152|"It seems like vscode is ignoring the ""http.proxy"" configuration when downloading extensions. For me, it works fine when listing extensions.  So, it's getting the IP resolved and connecting directly, rather than using a proxy."

158|Hi @jpoon,  Even if there is no selected text, you have to use the `selection` object. Something like this:  ```     // current editor     const editor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;      // check if there is no selection     if (editor.selection.isEmpty) {       // the Position object gives you the line and character where the cursor is       const position = editor.selection.active;     } ```  Hope this helps
