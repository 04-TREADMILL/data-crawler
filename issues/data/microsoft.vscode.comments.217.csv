21601|Can not reproduce neither on win10 neither on mac.
21602|This seems like our internal uri class sometims converts drive letter to uper case and sometimes not. @jacdavis I am not able to reproduce this though, can you please provide some example file so I can investigate into this further to see when this is happening - also does this happen when adding the first breakpoint? When I tried I always got the lowercase driver letter. Thanks!
21603|The problem here is that the append shows the output channel and all these call are async so the hide() actually gets exectued before the append(). @jrieken do we have some recommendation on how to use the API here?
21604|"@alexandrudima it doesn't work sometimes even when the counts _do_ match perfectly. Take this code as a test case:  ``` export const Texts = {   a: {     name: 'a',     order: 0,     label: (       <FormattedMessage         id=""Phases.aPhase.label""         defaultMessage=""a""         description=""Text for the 'a' state of a object""       />     ),     hint: (      ),   },   b: {     name: 'b',     order: 1,     label: (       <FormattedMessage         id=""Phases.bPhase.label""         defaultMessage=""b""         description=""Text for the 'b' state of a object""       />     ),     hint: (      ),   },   c: {     name: 'c',     order: 2,     label: (       <FormattedMessage         id=""Phases.cPhase.label""         defaultMessage=""Knock-out""         description=""Text for the 'c' state of a object""       />     ),     hint: (      ),   }, }; ```  To see the behaviour, select the **first** `hint: (` text, press <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd> twice to select the other two `hint: (` text also. Now, press <kbd>Up</kbd> arrow twice to go to the `/>` of the `<FormattedMessage...` JSX element, and position the multi-cursors at the **end** of those lines.  Now, select the whole JSX element, press <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>, bring back the cursors to the `hint` part and press <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd>. All three occurrences are pasted thrice."
21605|It would be nice if `__` and `**` would be colored, too, much like `[]()` or `>`.
21606|@dbaeumer No. I when into terminal folder, ran tsc. Got correct build message (that contains error related to my code). Then went into vscode, made some saves.... but the rebuild didn't happen in terminal.  (edit: i updated to vscode 1.1)
21607|I think this should be possible by setting VSCode as a default editor on Windows. @gregvanl do we have some documentation on how to do this?
21608|I don't know if this would help in VSCodes case, but @GregOnNet came up with a brilliant solution for adding HTML highlighting to the ` ` back-tick section here for Atom-typescript  https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/pull/948  Hoping that might help potentially add this ability to VSCode!

21610|@mahmoudymy I don't think is a good solution to hardcore template support for every framework out there. I want syntax highlighting in all kinds of template strings, in my gulp tasks, in my SQL queries, ...
21611|@faxue-msft The version fo the C++ extension that I have does not support `totalFrames` thus I can not get this behavior. How can I get the newest C++ extension for which I can reproduce this? I will first verify that the adapter returns a proper `totalFrames` field per each thread.
21612|@isidorn this is the behavior in the latest:  ![may-16-2016 15-41-02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1898161/15291189/f3f2e0e0-1b7c-11e6-9d40-66b77a6695c7.gif)  As you can see does the breakpoints view not only flicker, but resizes on every keystroke (even on a line that does not contain a breakpoint).
21613|@weinand forgot to metnion this happens also on the line before and after the breakpoint. Do you also see this behvaior if you type on line 1736 or 1740 in your example?
21614|Now we are immediatly disabling these actions, but only fully transitioning to running after 500ms (to avoid tree flickering). This should not break any behavior, though we should keep our eyes open.
21615|A bit disappointing this is still on the to-do list.
21616|"I actually used gulp to solve this issue, since while this is a vs code limitation, it also is a single-threaded limitation (cannot have two file-watchers for example). Instead, gulp is file-watching, I simply run the task from vs code so I can see the output and control the task life cycle. Note that I do not filewatch from the task.json and it happens inside the gulp file. Also the gulp file uses the tsconfig for properties, so tsc is configured in the usual manner.  ##### gulpfile.js  ``` javascript var gulp = require('gulp'); var markdown = require('gulp-markdown'); var ts = require('gulp-typescript');  gulp.task('markdown', function() {     return gulp.src('**/*.md')         .pipe(markdown())         .pipe(gulp.dest(""build/"")); });  var tsProject = ts.createProject('tsconfig.json'); gulp.task('typescript', function() {     var tsResult = tsProject.src()         .pipe(ts(tsProject));      return tsResult.js.pipe(gulp.dest('build')); });  gulp.task('default', function() {     gulp.watch('**/*.md', ['markdown']);     gulp.watch('**/*.ts', ['typescript']); }); ```  ---  ##### tasks.json  ``` json {     ""version"": ""0.1.0"",     ""command"": ""gulp"",     ""showOutput"": ""always"",     ""isShellCommand"": true,     ""tasks"": [         {             ""taskName"": ""default"",             ""isBuildCommand"": true,             ""showOutput"": ""always""         }     ] } ```"
21617|@viperscape This has little to do with being single-threaded, Gulp is just as single-threaded as VS Code itself, and tasks are always run in a seperate process.
21618|@Ikuyadeu Thanks for the change. Yes, the language contribution for stylus and sass should come from extensions. There are already a few: - https://github.com/robinbentley/vscode-sass-indented for sass indented (language id 'sass-indented')) - https://github.com/d4rkr00t/language-stylus for stylus (language id 'stylus')  Handing over this PR to @egamma who's owning the emmet integration.
21619|Yes, you're right, looks like they're all related.
21620|@isidorn the flicker only occurs when editing the line with the breakpoint and the line before.  But in any case, the flickering in the breakpoints view is unnecessary and looks silly.
21621|@felixfbecker the gulp task is watching _two_ file types simultaneously:  ``` javascript gulp.task('default', function() {     gulp.watch('**/*.md', ['markdown']);     gulp.watch('**/*.ts', ['typescript']); }); ```  Using [this](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/981#issuecomment-162331163) example: I'm not sure how you could simulate this using vscode tasks because filewatching is a blocking procedure.
21622|Please add this feature
21623|@sharang1 since you are passing two arguments to eval, what 'eval' are you using? What is '__code'? I assume it is a string with some JavaScript code. How do you set a breakpoint in that code?  Without this information I cannot investigate this. Thanks.
21624|When will this be in Alpha? I'd like to try it out with our debugAdapter.
21625|@chuckries the commit is already available in the latest OS X alpha build. And I've just started Windows and Linux builds.
21626|It's not in any of the existing C++ Extension, I was working on supporting more than 20 frames and discovered this bug. I can share with you some private bits if you don't have any other debugger support this already.
21627|@johnhidey is correct, this will be removed when reinstalling via deb/rpm packages. The best way to force args like this is to use an alias to override the code command by putting this in your `~/.bashrc` file:  ``` bash alias code='code --disable-gpu' ```
21628|This will be fixed by https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/6136
21629|Going to adding to @joaomoreno as I don't have access to a mac/vm right now.
21630|Only node debug so far supports this, but it is not multi threaded. If sharing private bits is complicated I can do some hacking on the vscode side to fake this behavior.  Did you verify on your side that the totalFrames returned by your adapter are correct for each thread respectively?
21631|@MarkPhillips can you open index.html in another editor at the point where you expected it to change? Assigning to @bpasero as it seems to be about saving files.
21632|I don't think tagging has been solidified in our release process yet. @joaomoreno normally handles this but he's out atm so I just added the tag.
21633|Have you tried to copy/paste it from/at the start of the line? ![div_html](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10991163/15297882/c881e2ce-1b9c-11e6-8fd5-14a26cd992b5.gif)
21634|+1
21635|@hbenl issue extracted into #6400
21636|I added another commits with word 'later' In Korean, '이상' doesn't mean 'later'.
21637|@viperscape this is issue is not about running two tasks in parallel, but defining different commands for different tasks
21638|@felixfbecker I understand, just pointing out that the current work around posted above does not ideally work for blocking commands, thus the gulp solution. I'm eager to do this all within vs code tasks, instead of gulp-- when full support is added. While it's being developed, I thought it was important to point this out, as I assume people might want to run a file watcher on multiple types of files to run separate commands on them; like compiling markdown and typescript. Additionally, if anyone is interested, there is gulp-run which might also fill any gaps in the mean time.
21639|@viperscape Even if VS Code supports multiple commands you will still not be able to run them in parallel...
21640|The `dpkg` error should be fixed when we offer our official repos. I added an item to the FAQ for the git error https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs/commit/c1ff6fafa2fc00e7d866b5dff708c1fb40a775a3
21641|@bpasero I love that you are switching from marked to markdown-it, it seems much more active and is pluggable. I would really love to see [checklists](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-checkbox) integrated by default, it is awesome for ToDo-lists - would it work to actually check a checkbox in the preview and it would change the source file? That would be awesome
21642|I like @kumarharsh and @jrieken 's [mockup](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/637#issuecomment-203482537). Using the sidebar as a result list / popular extensions list (maybe categories that can be collapsed) and showing the readme on the right like an open file while clicking through the results. It should be keyboard accessable (shortcut for opening the extensions area, navigate with arrow keys, install with enter) and should not be a blocking modal (Brackets 👎 ). Extensions should be able to install in the background (and please stop prompting to restart Code even if there are other extensions still installing).
21643|@hoovercj all I can currently say is that this is still on the backlog, sorry.
21644|I am late to this party, but are the tabs going to be optional? I use to think I missed them but now I don't. Just curious if there will be a way hide them. No hate towards tabs and people wanting to use them, just think I would prefer an toggle to show/hide. That's all keep up the great work. I love vscode.
21645|@isidorn Many thanks for looking into this. I have attached a  minimum sample program - and the log output from a debug session. You can install the Ravi Debugger extension from the marketplace and try to step through the sample program. Will run on Windows 10 64-bit only.  You can see from attached log (line 490, line 551, line 663) as the code steps through the script - the stack trace returned by the backend indicates that the source is to be retrieved via the sourceReference. However the front end never sends a source request.  By front end I mean VSCode. By backend I mean my debug executable.  Log file: [out1.txt](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/266921/out1.txt)  Sample script - please remove .txt extension: [simple-debug-test.lua.txt](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/266924/simple-debug-test.lua.txt)  Sample launch file - please remove .txt extension: [launch.json.txt](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/266925/launch.json.txt)
21646|btw if you have a /temp folder on the drive then the log file named out1.txt will be generated by the backend.
21647|Closing the PR.
21648|I am not sure what happened. I cannot replicate the issue anymore, but I had many times before contacting you. If this happens again, I'll let you know.

21649|Indentation isn't even being guessed correctly for me at all. I loaded a script that consists purely of tabbed indentations, but Code guessed four spaces instead and I have to manually change this setting every time I restart the program.  I've only tested with [this script](https://github.com/TingPing/plugins/blob/master/HexChat/highlight.lua) so far. To replicate, clone the entire repository and open the cloned plugins folder. Proceed to open the script in question and you will see that it incorrectly guessed four spaces. Tested in 1.1.0 and 1.1.1.
21650|At the very least you should be able to have different icons for different file extensions I believe. Ideally it might be nice to support some sort of regex matching so you could have custom icons for Angular Javascript files named with -controller.js for example.   I for one would rather have this then tabs and it seems like a lot less work for at least some basic start to be implemented.
21651|No problems
21652|"@isidorn This is what looks like in console, the output is the same from what on IDLE.

21654|ok, where do I define these styles?
21655|We always update electron to newer versions over time, but since 1.1.0 comes with a major Chrome/node.js update, we will likely skip the update for this sprint and look at this the next sprint.
21656|@lucnoc weird, not sure we heard an issue like this before. did you maybe start once as admin? could be a permission issue after all.   does it also reproduce from our insider build? http://code.visualstudio.com/Download#insiders
21657|That is standard OS behaviour, we do not have any chance to change this behaviour imho.

21662|Apparently the new wisdom is to not use .jsx file extensions, but rather to use .js instead. Can you enable this same functionality for .js extensions too please?
21663|as an aside, would you divulge what program you used to make those mockup pictures?
21664|@ciel, @stevencl  wrote that they used PowerPoint for it.  Personally, I love WireframeSketcher to do it but PowerPoint can work too. :)
21665|@dbaeumer I thought node_modules are already excluded by the search.exclude portion of the user settings? I'm having the same issues where symbols from excluded folders appear on the search.
21666|Known limitation of the debug hover - the hover is not aware of the AST structure of the document, thus it can not show hover if there are multiple variables named editor across scropes. In the future we plan to revisit our simple debug hover and that should take care of this limitation
21667|This looks like an issue with the C# extension, please file it against this repository https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode

21671|The standard built-in PHP support in VS code has no code formatter. Are you using an extension? Please file this issue against the extension's source repository.
21672|This is expected behavior. We have two different ways of providing errors: - build errors: they only disappear when running a new build. In the above example trigger Ctrl+Shift+B again (after saving) should remove the errors - reconcile errors: the come and go on typing. The are typically produced by language services like TS or linters.
21673|@vincent-ly search.exclude excludes them from full text search. If you want to exclude them from TS smartness you need to add a exclude property to the tsconfig.json as well.
21674|adding @stevencl for more insights.  The behaviour is designed like that and the reasoning is that it's otherwise harder to correlate the number we show in the group with the children and easy to miss the 2nd, 3rd, etc match in a file
21675|Just as @jamesmenera  mentioned i really miss the tabs and sidebar but i can see that a lot people like the Working Files approach so it should be optional.
21676|John, can you please merge this into our master database.
21677|@niceb5y thanks a lot for the contribution. Unfortunately, the i18n files are machine generated (as indicated in the comment) and we can't accept pull request on them. But I have the translation team to consider your changes and directly merge them into our translation database.
21678|@aeschli please see the latest comment. With what we discussed last week can we achieve the same?
21679|@Brakkar thanks. This then sounds like a watching problem with the tsc compiler. In the terminal you started tsc with tsc -w -p .
21680|@chrisdias assigning to you. This is more a general product decision.
21681|yeah, done like that
21682|I am very sorry to hear you are having issues with VS Code. I wonder if this issue is being caused by an installed extension. Can you try to run VS Code without extensions? From the command line, execute: `code --disable-extensions` and try your steps again to see if it reproduces. If you see it is an issue with the extension, please file it against the extension repository itself.
21683|@dbaeumer @egamma The solution mentioned above adds the html/angular syntax highlighting directly to the TypeScript grammar. That's one of the options we discussed last week. It would be up to the TypeScript team to decide that. Alternatively we work on adding injection support: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/6331.
21684|@CryZe unfortunately we can't accept PRs right now on i18n files. As the top level comment indicates these files are machine generated. However I have asked the translation team to consider the change in the main database.
21685|Moving to TS since we format JS using the TS formatter.
21686|This issue was moved to Microsoft/TypeScript#8641
21687|I tried opening code without extensions but the issue still persists.
21688|Just to be sure: the switch is --disable-extensions not --disable-extension
21689|yeah, seems like a flaky test. change LGTM. thanks for the contribution!
21690|> async so the hide() actually gets exectued before the append().  @isidorn Unsure where that happens? The calls made in `ExtHostOutputService` should be in order despite being async.
21691|@magnasteyr could you use a program like process monitor (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processmonitor.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) on your machine to see which process writes file below the workspace directory. I am still pretty confident that the changes to file in the workspace folder constantly trigger reparsing in the tsserver.
21692|I need to add php path for validation. I have to add path to C:\xampp\php\php.exe but its not getting edited in user settings under preferences
21693|Yes and no. The behaviour of [`set([uri,diag[]][])`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L2502) has changed such that repeating uris in the array of uri/diagnostics tuples aren't merged anymore. Ever since the doc hinted into that direction (sort of) but bringing back that behaviour should be no harm.
21694|[This is](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/api/node/extHostDiagnostics.ts#L75) where repeated uris in the set of tuples override the previous diagnostic (of that call). [Before](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/81456a7212340902825f13985ec0c2867b482aad/src/vs/workbench/api/node/extHostDiagnostics.ts#L83) keeping diagnostics locally we would send them as is.
21695|"@dbaeumer On terminal, when I launch tsc -w -p it says ""Compiler option 'project' expects an argument."" When I run 'tsc -w' it DOES auto compile on the terminal when i save file. It didn't auto compile in the terminal previously because I only launched with 'tsc'.  In vscode 1.1.1, it's the same: after launching the first build with shift+command+b it builds and watches for changes. But it then rebuilds only when I save files. Isn't it supposed to auto rebuild without needing a save ?  For a reminder, here are my options in tasks.json:  { // See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558 // for the documentation about the tasks.json format ""version"": ""0.1.0"", ""command"": ""tsc"", ""isShellCommand"": true, ""args"": [""-w"", ""-p"", "".""], ""showOutput"": ""always"", ""isWatching"": true, ""problemMatcher"": ""$tsc-watch"" }"

Here is the output of the cmd line:  ``` C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VS Code>.\Code.exe --disable-extensions  C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VS Code> [9588:9596:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service_main.cc(68)] Session start. cmdline is [--reporter-url=https://ticinocrashreporter.azurewebsites.net/crash --application-name=VSCode - -v=1] [9588:9596:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(142)] window handle is 00010CB4 [9588:9596:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(290)] pipe name is \\.\pipe\VSCode Crash Service dumps at C:\Users\myuser\AppData\Local\Temp\VSCode Crashes [9588:9596:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(294)] checkpoint is C:\Users\myuser\AppData\Local\Temp\VSCode Crashes\crash_checkpoint.txt server is https://ticinocrashreporter.azurewebsites.net/crash maximum 128 reports/day reporter is electron-crash-service [9588:9596:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service_main.cc(84)] Ready to process crash requests [9588:9628:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(323)] client start. pid = 9768 [9588:9628:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(323)] client start. pid = 10132 [9488:9408:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service_main.cc(68)] Session start. cmdline is [--reporter-url=https://ticinocrashreporter.azurewebsites.net/crash --application-name=VSCode - -v=1] [9488:9408:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(142)] window handle is 00010CB8 [9488:9408:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(290)] pipe name is \\.\pipe\VSCode Crash Service dumps at C:\Users\myuser\AppData\Local\Temp\VSCode Crashes [9488:9408:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(294)] checkpoint is C:\Users\myuser\AppData\Local\Temp\VSCode Crashes\crash_checkpoint.txt server is https://ticinocrashreporter.azurewebsites.net/crash maximum 128 reports/day reporter is electron-crash-service [9488:9408:0517/105455:ERROR:crash_service.cc(301)] could not start dumper  ```  And here are the last lines of the operation:log.txt file:  ``` reporter is electron-crash-service [9588:9596:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service_main.cc(84)] Ready to process crash requests [9588:9628:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(323)] client start. pid = 9768 [9588:9628:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(323)] client start. pid = 10132 [9488:9408:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service_main.cc(68)] Session start. cmdline is [--reporter-url=https://ticinocrashreporter.azurewebsites.net/crash --application-name=VSCode --v=1] [9488:9408:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(142)] window handle is 00010CB8 [9488:9408:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(290)] pipe name is \\.\pipe\VSCode Crash Service dumps at C:\Users\myuser\AppData\Local\Temp\VSCode Crashes [9488:9408:0517/105455:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(294)] checkpoint is C:\Users\myuser\AppData\Local\Temp\VSCode Crashes\crash_checkpoint.txt server is https://ticinocrashreporter.azurewebsites.net/crash maximum 128 reports/day reporter is electron-crash-service [9488:9408:0517/105455:ERROR:crash_service.cc(301)] could not start dumper  ```  Again, there is no difference when starting vscode using --disable-extensions switch. Next I'm going to analyse with process monitor...
