17509|"As a web developer, **Tabs** are important to me. Unlike desktop programmers (who mainly focus on single file at the time), we always switch between windows & using Mouse at the same time (e.g., Slicing an image from Photoshop, and then back to editor immediately. Or debugging in browsers, and go back to another file to do fixing). With tabs, we can navigate to target file quickly. With shortcuts, it's 2 more steps. With sidebar ""working files"", it's less space in the main code area (as we put Photoshop & Editor or browsers side by side). `Height` in editor are less necessary. You are always able to memorize few more lines, don't you?  Also, Top Tabs are better for human eyes. You can scan the top tab title and main area code at same time. But you can't read left `working files` with the main code together. Try it yourself. Furthermore, Tabs are wider, better for mouse movement. (Even you won't focus on it, it's more predictable)"

Potential issues I see: - accessibility with tab navigation will be broken if the order of elements in the DOM is different from the visual order - layout might flicker more if the elements moved are not in order in the DOM as visually appearing (have seen this with the panel and editor area before)

17536|Please also look into how [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is implemented. It has a simpler scoring system (just plain subsequence search I believe) but it's extremely fast. It doesn't even build an index AFAIK.  FWIW this would be the killer feature that would most certainly get me to switch to VS Code. But in any case thanks for your hard work.

17539|@vsccarl these changes are quite fresh, on what vscode version did you verify it?
17540|@dzannotti The issue I had had been there ever since I updated VS Code some months ago. Back when I first installed VSC (around September 2015, give or take a month) auto-indentation and code completion worked by default. It stopped working after updating, but at the time I was busy writing code for a final exam and didn't submit a bug report. The point is, issue with python usability is not new to 1.0 version. Addition of the extensions didn't do anything at all. For python VSC is basically a bare bones text-field.  (I posted this on the other thread too dzannotti, but I meant to post here. Sorry for the double mention.)

Back when I first installed VSC (around September 2015, give or take a month) auto-indentation and code completion worked by default.  This is another scenario, let's keep this out of this issue :smile: . This is the interesting scenario.  The babel extension, contributes/overloads the JS extension and contributes a tmGrammar for JS  ``` ""languages"": [             {                 ""id"": ""javascript"",                 ""aliases"": [                     ""Javascript (Babel)""                 ],                 ""extensions"": [                     "".js"",                     "".jsx"",                     "".es6""                 ],                 ""firstLine"": ""^#!.*\\bnode"",                 ""mimetypes"": [                     ""text/javascript""                 ]             }         ], ```  When you open the language menu then `javascript (babel)` doesn't show up anymore.
