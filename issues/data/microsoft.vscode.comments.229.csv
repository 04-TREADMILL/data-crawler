22801|I just noticed I have installed clip-x: that's a Windows app which keeps the clipboard history.  I don't think I have any VSCode extension that interacts with the clipboard.  I have disabled Clip-X to see if it's causing the problem (I noticed that when I encounter the bug, I have an empty entry in clip-x).  Then I'll start VSCode with extensions disabled if I'm still having the problem.
22802|@edumunoz here are my answers to the questions from above: - it is possible to pass the selected launch config section to the pick action. I had planned this anyway. - local vs. remote: why make this decision in the pick process? The launch.json could have two launch configs, one for the local and one for remote case. For this it would use a `${action.PickProcess}` and a `${action.PickRemoteProcess}`. Your extension would implement two pick commands for this. - having more than one action in the active launch.json entry: yes, we will pass the launch config. - launching the pick action via the command palette: only if we cannot make these actions invisible will the user be able to run the action, but the result will go to /dev/null anyway. - How is the result string communicated from the debug adapter to VSCode? The string is not communicated back from the debug adapter, but from the picker command running in the extension (host). These are different processes. The string (pid etc.) becomes the command's result. Since VS Code is running the command as part of the start debug session action, the result can be assigned to the system variable and then the substitution mechanism will place it in the launch config.
22803|fixed with https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/0ac95a8f1d3b831349018669bdd7bc31fa3efe37
22804|It is possible to invoke a task (build command) before launching, for instance you can use `preLaunchTask` in your `launch.json`. More details can be found here https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging  Automatically invoking any vscode command before starting debug is currently not supported.
22805|It is not possible to implement this behavior by an extension. Jump to error by doudble clicking error message is built in vscode. However not all formats of errors are supported, so some error paths are not detected. Please search our github issue history since there are multiple issues already opened about jump to error for more details.
22806|Yep, it most likely is the auto whitespace removal, after pressing Enter the line number 2 is marked as containing auto-whitespace. The next edit is on line 1, so the model assumes the auto whitespace on line number 2 is safe to remove (it assumes the user voluntarily edited line number 1 and doesn't care anymore about line number 2).  Except this was not a voluntary edit, it was an auto format edit...
22807|@jrieken where does the folder 'etc' come from?
22808|I have no clue, maybe @aeschli knows?
22809|I have merged the configurations as Joh suggested. Notice that for maxVisible having a negative value I still show the open editors seciton - not sure if that is the desired behavior or I should just treat that as 0. I want the hide thing to be explicit so the user could not get it hidden by accident.

22811|This is now fixed, as the first launch config is not launched but the action is just ignored. There is still issue #6809 that errors are not propagated properly - looking into that one now
22812|Currently the command returns the errors, after consulting with Joh it is the extensions responsibility to handle this error in any way the extension writer wants. Closing as designed.

22813|I still very much like this change because it makes `--verbose` much easier to use. I think in any way you would see the chrome output. There is `ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING` but that does not seem to have any impact.
22814|Thanks, I merged your PR and assigned @joaomoreno to verify.
22815|@isidorn What error is returned if attribute 'type' is missing?
22816|What do you mean in any way?
22817|@joaomoreno so far if you wanted to use --verbose you would have had to launch from the executable location and that would give you the chrome output too.
22818|"@isidorn just make sure that the error message passed to the following error handler is something like ""launch config 'foobar' doesn't exist"":   ``` ts     vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.startDebug', 'foobar').then(() => {         vscode.window.showInformationMessage('OK!');     }, err => {         vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Error: ' + err.message);     }); ```"

22860|Extending the protocol is easy. But before we do this we need some evidence that debug adapters can actually provide that information. In case of node.js I do not see a way to provide source and line information. `console.log()` statements in the debuggee result in information sent to stdout (or stderr) which is picked up by the debug adapter and sent as OutputEvents to VS Code. The debug adapter has no way to add source and line information by itself. Only an enhanced version of `console.log()` in the debuggee could get source and line position from the callstack and add this to the output data.   @roblourens, @felixfbecker, @rebornix could you provide source and line information for anything sent as OutputEvents?

22880|I agree, this would be a useful addition.  Currently in the Mac version, it's only possible to rename files by focusing to the Explorer sidebar, moving up or down to the current file, and pressing Enter to edit the name.
22881|I found the difference:   I run in a VM. When I have the source in the window file system everything works fine and the break point is hit. When I have the source on the Mac (which is transparently mounted  as a windows drive) then - playing exactly the same scenario - the break point is not hit.  This seems to suggest that this is either a timing issue or some kind of line delimiter issue. If it's a timing issue I wonder if people using code on mounted network drives etc. could experience it too.
22882|@kieferrm I suspect this is a UNC file path issue.
22883|@jrieken perhaps a configurable option to always have them on top/bottom/auto would satisfy everyone?
22884|Would love this feature! We regularly share code, and it would be much easier to read/understand if there's color coding and indentation.
22885|@alexandrudima It does the trick, I didn't know the command existed.  I wonder though, is there still a case for this feature? I guess with a dedicated command, you could keep pressing or hold a shortcut to undo all selections, although that doesn't seem very useful, and you could do the same with `esc` anyway. I can't think of any use cases where `cmd+u` won't do the trick - I'm trying. I think I may be concluding that this issue may be moot.  The only real benefit is probably that it will be easier to find and more appropriate as a dedicated command. The fact that there is a [question on SO without answers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36613291/undo-editor-action-addselectiontonextfindmatch) is an indication that this is not easy to figure out.

22892|This has been the behaviour since inception.  Even after staging, you can make further changes in `url.ts`. Thus, there is a need for 3 models: the HEAD version, the index version (staged) and the working tree version. The first two are in memory.  What is the real issue here?
22893|"UX meeting outcome: we think we should provide a setting that allows a user to decide where new editors open. We need this already for tabs (to the right of active editor, to the left of active editor) and we could just let this be an enum with more values (to the beginning of all editors, at the end). Setting this to ""at the end"" would restore pretty much how working files used to behave."
22894|Alright, good to know. I will close it since it seems this is very specific to your system.

The following screenshot shows that node.js reports the file path for the 'debugger' statement back with a UNC path (green border), which VS Code opens in read-only mode in the editor (see the bogus ""core module"" detail at the end).  But the breakpoint is registered with a driveletter path (red border in the tracing information).   ![2016-05-25 18-19-31](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1898161/15547761/8a436a40-22a5-11e6-8121-72b6419b0d47.png)  When registering breakpoints in node.js we already use a regular expression to account for drive letter casing differences, but we do not yet handle the UNC vs. drive letter difference.  I will close this issue (because with this finding the title has become misleading) and create a new bug."
22898|"Outcome from the UX meeting: - we will shorten the names of the actions when they appear in their context   - editor: close, close others, (close all?)   - editor shown as tab: additionally ""close left"", ""close right""   - group: move left, move right, close all - we will drop actions that target other contexts (no close all groups, close other groups in the context of editors or groups)"
22899|@isidorn moving to you so that we address this very specific to the explorer problem: can we play around with a delay that only applies when you click from the explorer that allows me to still double click without the thing moving down?
