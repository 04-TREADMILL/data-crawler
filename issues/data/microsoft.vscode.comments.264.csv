26302|@bpasero Any reproducing steps? It's likely not the language server that made up these resources. The language server just validates what he is asked to do.
26303|Fixed by @bpasero via c423fe9, 9dede06
26304|No steps, I am just using this tool in selfhost.
26305|@aeschli actually found it: - open git.contribution.css - make a change - open the file in diff viewer
26306|"Can not repro this both on win10 and os x. Do you still see the behavior with ""workbench.showEditorTabs"": false?

26307|Done?
26308|I have had the same problem with a vertical scroll bar not appearing using v1.2.1.  I was really digging the terminal window, but need to be able to see history so I may have to go back to another command window for now.
26309|From the milestone and the tag of the commit, I have the impression this should be fixed in 1.2.1? Asking because it still reproduces...
26310|There you go. You can also see all my settings on the screenshot. Btw., I notice my explorer view looks whole lot differently than yours. ![explorer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5485902/16122327/50ba8816-33ef-11e6-866e-a4f2762879d4.gif)
26311|I find the old way nicer to read, more examples:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/16122392/2e8e0536-33e7-11e6-84db-c07acbfe84dd.png)
26312|"ow ... and yes - it is all the same with ""workbench.showEditorTabs"": false. Also here I demonstrate it with split view, but it is all the same without splits."
26313|@bpasero it is version 1.2.0 Again, if the laptop is offline, the code --version doesn't even work (nothing is displayed).
26314|oookay ... found the difference between mine and yours - you have a folder opened. If I open a folder - all looks just as yours and ok, when I close the folder - then the above happens.
26315|The document has URI `inmemory://model/3`. The extension host gets a document open event on it. The language client sends it the the css extension which validates it and sends back problems.  @dbaeumer @jrieken @alexandrudima Any opinons where we should cut the flow? IMO the css language service should not make decisions on what documents to validate, it is just a service. Maybe the extension host clients should not get document open events for diff documents. Or maybe the problem view should only show error for file resources located in the workspace.
26316|"I created a batch file with contents `code --user-data-dir=""data/"" --extensionHomePath=""extensions/""`. On launch: - A data folder is created and populated, this part works fine. - An extensions folder is created, but nothing appears within it. When I try and `ext install base16`, it doesn't actually load and throws an error when I press escape to get rid of the dialog"
26317|Wow, that seems to indicate a problem with Electron unless I am mistaken because we use Electron as node, correct @joaomoreno @Tyriar ?
26318|Yes - this is as designed - you have a no workspace view and in that case we always show the open editors view. As soon as you open a folder for your workspace that setting will be respected.  If more users find this confusing I can reopen this issue and always respect that setting even in a no folder workspace.
26319|Please reopen if you still see this with our new markdown extension.
26320|Seems to work ok for me with our new markdown extension:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/16123181/68f4b352-33ea-11e6-9682-f1bfe451536f.png)
26321|@rebornix @kieferrm did we loose the ability to provide custom CSS with the markdown preview?
26322|Could It also be possible for users to define an overridable stylesheet to override the defaults? For example say I want to use twitter-bootstrap for my styles...
26323|@kieferrm maybe a case for an extension for the markdown extension?
26324|I am closing this because markdown is now a real extension like any other language.
26325|Ok lets close this.
26326|Verified that this still does not work with the new markdown extension.
26327|Fixed with our new markdown extension.
26328|Should be ok now.
26329|Works now 👍
26330|@isidorn works like a charm!  One issue: on success use the body.value as the new value for the variable, not the value passed as an argument.
26331|These keys work for me.

26345|Still an issue with our new markdown extension.
26346|Even with our new markdown extension I still see issues rendering the bullets:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/16124272/93f6c604-33ee-11e6-8f17-5f8a560dd808.png)
26347|This is still an issue even with our new markdown extension.
26348|Still happens with our new markdown extension:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/16124420/2bb31f9c-33ef-11e6-95f8-29a4eb84c5ee.png)
26349|Please reopen if you still see this in our June release.
26350|We used to have a way to configure the CSS to use for previewing but I am not sure we lost this with our new markdown extension.
26351|In this case I was opening the preview of 2 different markdowns, both named readme.md though.
26352|This is still the case with the new extension. There is no model around to be updated.   @kieferrm I think the extension also needs to listen to file changes that happen to the file and do the right thing.
26353|Running into this problem with 1.2.1 on Mac too.
26354|Marking important because we look silly. Can we not just in the marker service ignore markers produced for non-file non-untitled resource schemes?   Is there a use case for seeing warnings in the left hand side of a diff editor or even on files on the git index?
26355|Thanks for the response. I tried it out and it still uses the previously opened path. Try something like this: 1) Open up a source file. Say c:\squid\squid.cs 2) Open up another source file: c:\clam\clam.cs 3) Use back to reopen squid.cs 4) Open the file open dialog. The open folder will still be on c:\clam.   What I was suggesting is to set the open dialog's current folder to the document that currently has focus, regardless of how we arrived at that document.
26356|Yes please ! Indentation Guides are needed!
26357|@kliemohn there is still no scrollbar https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js/issues/77, but I believe this scrolling issue is fixed with the change to https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js
26358|@jacdavis how do you open the file dialog?
26359|I would be very cautious about changing the current keyboard short cut toggling behavior for the panels.  Developers get muscle memory (Ctrl+Shift+Y, Ctrl+Shift+U, Ctrl+`) for quickly bringing up and dismissing a panel and they likely won't be happy if it changes.  I don't think there is harm in having duplication with Ctrl+J to toggle any active panel.
26360|Ctrl-O
26361|I have the same issue with this update. It's easy to fix by re-downloading the installer, but still it would be better to have a button to re-download the update, or for VSCode to detect failed installs and re-download the update automatically.
26362|Benjamin,  I lost another hour of my work and got little more details how it happened: 1. I made updates to a remote file 2. I saved the updates and I saw that the black dot near the file name disappeared 3. I lost connection to the remote mount 4. I recovered connection 5. The file in the section 'Working Files' started having the black dot and showing old version 6. I saved the file and override my changes.  I hope this will help you to fix this. Thank you.

26367|@Tyriar this is likely a regression from my settings change.
26368|This looks pretty similar to #5154 or #1896.
26369|Note that the tabs setting is now called: `workbench.editor.showTabs`
