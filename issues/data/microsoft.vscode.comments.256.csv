25553|Unfortunately not... You could use our [Insiders build](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/05/23/evolution-of-insiders) for a while, which already has the fix.
25554|For some reason, each of those folders seem to be git repository in themselves (they contain a `.git`). At the same time, the folder in which they are contained is also a git repository (containing a `.git`).  This is very strange and an invalid git scenario, unless you are attempting to create git submodules.  I suggest to either remove the top level `.git` folder in the containing folder, and open each one of those folders in Code; or vice-versa: remove each of the subfolders' `.git` folders and keep opening the containing folder.
25555|That looks as if oniguruma was compiled natively with the wrong node version. I find weird that the error message shows `/node_modules/vscode-textmate/node_modules/oniguruma` instead of `/node_modules/oniguruma` given we now flatten the node modules.  @joaomoreno Do we delete the old node_modules folder before installing an update?  @Tyriar Can you check what your fs looks around the `node_modules` folder? I think it should be flat, otherwise it means the update is broken (leaving old nested `node_modules` behind).

25583|@JimiC thanks for jumping in. It is exactly the way to address the problem. Closing.
25584|I tried today and seems it work as expected.  ~~Maybe was related with some comand used friday. I will investigate the posible cause of that behavior.~~  EDIT:   The problem is with ionic client. I was running `ionic serve` that watch src directory.  Steps to reproduce: 1. Toggle  integrated terminal. 2. Run ionic serve on a ionic project. 3. Create a new folder, with a new file in a watched directory (ie. www/js/test/test.js). 4. Drag and drop that folder into another folder inside a watched directory (ie. www/js/second/test/test.js). 5. That breaks ionic cli, showing an error in terminal, and you return to prompt. 6. Now, you can use terminal normally, but if you type exit it can not be reloaded.  I tried in a blank project, and error displays but you can exit normally. I am using babel transpiler in my current project so, I should be a specific issue with livereload related to ionic and not to VS Code.
25585|@Artazor didn't make myself clear enough: this is not a technical problem. The TypeScript team is working on addressing it. I The coding of that feature has to happen in this https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript and not in VS Code itself. We use the tsserver from that repository via npm inside VS Code.
25586|@Tyriar You are right.. all panels are having that behavior now (toggle display and focus). I think not toggling the display would be better user experience. Switching focus between active editor and panels like Problems, Terminal and Debug would be really helpful. Instead of inventing a new command for this, it would be good to slightly change the existing command to do this. This will also be consistent with views behavior.  @bpasero Yah, I do not think of any use case either. But I think this would cause some inconsistency.. To dismiss any panel, user can use Ctrl/Cmd + J.  Do you think is there any loss of functionality if we make Output panel consistent with other panels?
25587|@Jonatthu which version of the tsc are you using. I suspect some @next version. If so using the tsdk variable is the right thing to do since VS Code in the box ships with the stable 1.8.x branch which doesn't have that feature yet.

25590|@marvinhagemeister any extension installed. VS Code doesn't offer a format on save of JS files and triggering format from the context menu in the editor doesn't format the code that way.
25591|wow - I always thought it's by alphabet...
25592|@mocanu-razvan I am pretty confident that this is caused by our files section. Adding a files sections limits our project to those two files and if you open other files not referenced by those two files then they end up in an isolated virtual project. You either need to leave out the files section (then all .ts files underneath the tsconfig.json file are automatically considered part of the project) or you need to list all files of your project in that section.
25593|@BurtHarris can you provide your tasks.json file?
25594|@dbaeumer There is little custom control about accept characters, _internally_ we have a property [`noAutoAccept`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/editor/common/modes.ts#L387) which should be set to false for textual completions
25595|@theor [This](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/html/browser/webview.ts#L121) is the smallish list of variables that you can use. Their value is derived from the current theme and changes when the theme changes.
25596|True. I couldn't reproduce that behavior.
25597|@warpdesign The view your html is rendered in uses some css [variables](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/html/browser/webview.ts#L121) which hold values for the background and foreground colors. Would those be sufficient?
25598|@dbaeumer @JimiC Oh well, I fell stupid for not having thought of that! It was indeed an extension that caused this behaviour.  Thanks for your help!
