22501|Note that you may have a single suggestion due to a couple of different scenarios: - You typed `he` and the only suggestion is `hello`. - You typed `hello` and the only suggestion is `hello`. - You typed `helloworld` and the only suggestion is `hello`. - You typed `something` and the only suggestion is `hello`.  Should we not eat up the keybindings in all those cases? Not so sure.
22502|Done with testing.. it works as expected. Closing.
22503|The error mentions that the object in which the method `hasOwnProperty` is executed is `null`, not that it's not an object. Your changes do not fix the issue, unfortunately.
22504|Alright closing it then, feel free to reopen.
22505|Nah. Make the `get` method of the configuration service be async.
22506|@joaomoreno how is that relevant? in all these cases you select the one entry for me in the suggest window so I do not need to type arrow-down to pick it. In the case of 1 suggestion, let me type arrow down to navigate lines.
22507|As implemented
22508|How many changes do you have in your git repository?
22509|@aaskat any update on this?
22510|@jsloyer Where did the issue surface?
22511|As designed. Usually, cli tools work this way.
22512|The publisher is part of the id, it is required to uniquely identify the extension.  We will change the marketplace instructions to use the id.
22513|Can you provide a screenshot?
22514|Probably not, this is a big endeavour, since a merge UI needs to be implemented.
22515|Tested.
22516|You mean this [`get`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/platform/configuration/common/configuration.ts#L20)-method? We only recently made it sync ;-)
22517|"I am not sure if this is a node issue but if I: - `echo ""hello"" > info.txt` - `fs.readFileSync(""info.txt"")`  The resulting buffer contains a terminating `\n`"
22518|We made filtering already independent of the currentWord but use text selected by `overrideBefore` (which default to the current word). In effect filtering is now custom to each suggestion. I wonder if we can do the same for selecting the best match.
22519|Looks good. Closing.
22520|My feeling is that this happens because the main process of VS Code is associated with the first desktop and the second window talks to the main process to bring up the window. I am not sure how to change this.
22521|For tasks I think it is actually useful yo distinguish between Linux and OS X since it refers to programs to be executed which can be different. However thinking about it tasks should even distinguish between different Linux distributions since they can have different disk layouts.
22522|I was tinkering with a UI enhancement and ran into this.
22523|@bgashler1 this would rather be an issue with VS Code not detecting file changes. I tried to reproduce with a simple case but failed:  ![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/15500428/f6db95b8-21a8-11e6-8bf7-d2d7547e60fc.gif)  Does it reproduce all the time for you? Specific steps?
22524|@alexandrudima where are you seeing the 'unixLike' ?
22525|As per https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/71f93aa38eed15c56d23845904e4dab245b86cc3/src/vs/workbench/electron-browser/main.ts#L53-L55  ,  need to set VSCODE_CLI=1 envvar to make this work.  For example, using latest release:  ```  Version 1.1.1 Commit def9e32467ad6e4f48787d38caf190acbfee5880 Date 2016-05-13T13:38:00.094Z Shell 0.37.6 Renderer 49.0.2623.75 Node 5.10.0 ```  The following still gets overwritten:  ``` sh GOPATH=/tmp code .  # shell's rc exports GOPATH=/something/different # process.env.GOPATH=/something/different, not /tmp ```  The following works as expected:  ``` sh GOPATH=/tmp VSCODE_CLI=1 code . # even though shell's rc exports GOPATH=/something/different, # process.env.GOPATH=/tmp ```
22526|Looks like this has to be supported across CSS, SASS and LESS.
22527|These are used for variables see #3077. Hence they are enabled.
22528|this is really annoying.
22529|I still see this with latest using the sample above
22530|@jrieken this doesn't seem to be the case for JS. Here is a screen shot with Code Complete in a JS file in our smoke test. Interestingly snippets appear at the end here:  ![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1931590/15501164/50d33dca-21ac-11e6-8caf-171e03a6b379.png)
22531|I will remove the May milestone since this is nothing we can cleanup for May. However we need to agree on a better story here.
22532|I am opting for not showing settings at all...
22533|Good catch. That's for sure for those that come from old workers...
22534|Dup of #6674
22535|my guess is that that's because of the sortText some suggestions in JS have. we should digg into that...
22536|"Hi, it seems I missed something  :  Here is my configuration (Domain / User / Pass are Url Encoded in the following pictures) ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2266487/15501332/3844ea8c-21ad-11e6-8dc4-145284537e7f.png) ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2266487/15501186/7026bc9c-21ac-11e6-922a-a00d423ef6bc.png)  DevTools : ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2266487/15501961/35047e6a-21b1-11e6-832e-51e2af994894.png)  I've even tried to run ""code"" from a prompt command after a couple of : SET HTTP_PROXY=""...."" SET HTTPS_PROXY=""....""  I've also tried http/https on my proxy scheme to be sure, and also with or without the encoded Domain / user / pass The result is always the same ==> HTTP 407 (Proxy Authentication Required).  CNTLM is definitly NOT an option for multiple good reasons that i won't discuss here. I'd like to solve this issue within VsCode configuration  FYI : Visual Studio 2013 / 2015 / dotnet.exe (via command line) / npm / ... WORKS with the proxy perfectly and the URI : https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json is also accessible from the network here"
22537|which git = /usr/local/bin/git echo $PATH = /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin  I tend to always open vscode using the command line via an automator script.  Just now I started vscode using finder and it worked.  I then tried it via the automator script and it didn't work.  I then tried it using the command line directly and it worked.  I then tried via the automator script again and it worked.  My automator script is simply a bash shell with the following: /usr/local/bin/code $@
22538|Yes, it is because of the sort text. @aeschli and I debugged it. However from an end user experience this is confusing. We should invest into a better and more consistent story here.
22539|`integratedTerminal.shell.unixLike` configuration option. My point is that in the rest of VSCode we have two explicit settings/options for osx / linux. I wasn't sure what you do for the `launch.json` (i.e. can there be platform specific settings and how does it look like)
22540|Not sure about that. Assigning to @bpasero to get his opinion
22541|You are correct, the merge decorators don't show up if the file is already opened, you must open a different file and then go back to the conflicting one:  ![merge-decorators](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5047891/15503794/ff33d2b2-21bb-11e6-8533-4df8637c0acd.gif)
22542|You should check with your proxy administrator to know how authentication should happen. Usually the `http://user:password@host:port/` scheme works.
22543|We now set this variable in all places that code should launch from the command line.  So, what is the full location of your global `code` command?
22544|Actually that doesn't even work if 3 and 4 are left out.
22545|... when the settings.json file is dirty.
22546|This is very odd. No idea what is going on there... If you open it several times successfully with the Automator script, the reproducibility is random?
22547|The same problem occurs on Ubuntu 16.04 when using `clear` -- the cursor disappears
22548|This works fine on Windows. On OS X and linux only 8192 characters are coming through the output event. It seems that console.log uses a buffer of that size.
22549|Concerning your last comment, [the id is indeed `ms-vscode.csharp`, isn't it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)?
22550|Agree. The idea of the _sortText_ was to give suggestions with complex labels a any chance to get a good sorting. Problem with JS salsa suggestion is that it sets the sort text to either `0` or `1`.
22551|Yes, drives me nuts as well.
22552|It seems random at initial start up.  If it's working the first time I launch the app it tends to stay working until I shut down my computer.  The reverse is true as well.  If it's not working at initial start up then it tends not to work up until I shut down my computer.
22553|@stevencl @bgashler1 what are your thoughts on using enablement? my fear is that enablement is not strong enough indicator if you have a editor group that is not active (and the action shows with slight dimming).
22554|Yes, I agree keeping Linux and OS X separate is preferred. For debug adapters we use these names:  ![2016-05-24 14-40-43](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1898161/15504110/a6f6a8c0-21bd-11e6-9315-1fa384d5475d.png)
22555|@jrieken can you clarify how this would work?  - are you saying that ~ shows all editors and ~left shows all editors of the left group - are you suggesting to have a close action within quick open? - are you suggesting to use the same sort order for navigating across all groups vs a single group?
22556|Noticed this too but it could just be a consequence of the font we are using. We could also play with opacity to draw it less prominent.
22557|@bgashler1 assigning to you because it is related to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6756 too.
22558|Agree.
22559|I think this is fine as long as we put a proper comment in settings to explain this.
22560|Not super comfortable with the setting name, but I lack a better suggestion.
22561|> Is this expected?  It's cool but it should not be like that ;-)
22562|I mean the keyword `where` will not be highlighted, just rendered with no color.
22563|@cliffowen What keyboard layout do you have configured?  What happens when you go to Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts and click on the Define Keybinding and type `cmd + numpad+` , `cmd + numapd-` ?:  Here I am doing it with `ctrl` as I am on a Windows machine:  ![keybindings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5047891/15504406/0fbf366e-21bf-11e6-889c-a99e0155a159.gif)
22564|We reverted the change in favour of the real solution which needs more work and is outlined in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6789
22565|https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6789
22566|https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6789
22567|> are you saying that ~ shows all editors and ~left shows all editors of the left group  No, first I suggest to not use `~`, then yes `left` shows all editors from the left group, `right` all editors from the right group (corresponding to the title the Open Editors section).   > are you suggesting to have a close action within quick open?  Yes, like Cmd+P is having an icon to open to the side  > are you suggesting to use the same sort order for navigating across all groups vs a single group?  No, I suggest that the sorting of left/center/right groups equals the sorting of the corresponding quick open piece.
22568|`code --disable-extensions` disables only user installed extensions and allows the built-in extensions. Is it possible that you have some left-over extensions in your extensions folder ?  ``` Windows %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions Mac ~/.vscode/extensions Linux ~/.vscode/extensions ```  If that folder is empty, then `code --disable-extensions` should be identical to `code` without the flag.
22569|I suggest to just close it.
22570|We already have a proper comment in settings ping @stevencl to also get his opinion  closing for now  ![screen shot 2016-05-24 at 15 02 40](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1926584/15504713/94565352-21c0-11e6-8fbd-0ac55d68e994.png)
22571|+1 for making the groups more explicit in quick open and accessible.  @jrieken currently we also have `~` for showing a list of all opened editors in their spatial order (tabs like, `Cmd+Alt+Tab`) and then we have `~>` for showing editors in their MRU order per group (corresponds to pressing `Cmd+Tab`). Would you still expect `~` to work as today (with maybe added close actions)?
22572|@isidorn I meant it is fine for me to merge both options. we can add it if people are confused.
22573|`unixLike` felt strange to me, when I first saw it. I would keep it separate too.
22574|@stevencl having a hard time reproducing this, any more reproducible steps? can you reliably reproduce?
22575|@stevencl @jrieken @joaomoreno sorry, it should be Ctrl+Tab on Mac not Cmd+Tab for navigating in MRU order. I guess you figured that out already.
22576|Yes, I can repro it each time. For example: ![overflow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1704059/15505169/24a0cf70-21ba-11e6-87bc-1bb2bdb8ece2.gif)
22577|@aleksey-pastuhov You could also try upgrading to vscode 1.1 which includes a new Chromium version (49 instead of 45!), maybe it got fixed in the meantime in Chromium
22578|You are correct. My mistake. ms-vscode is the publisher and csharp the extension name. Got confused since our extensions all begin with vscode- in the name which actually is somehow bogus.
22579|I could not repro this, but pushed a fix which should prevent this null pointer exception.
22580|It would be great to be able to cascade peek definition (and references). Visual Studio supports cascading peek and shows a breadcrumb above the peek window to indicate how deep you have gone: ![peek](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1704059/15505464/9484b59e-21bb-11e6-8acc-e9c57b18b51f.png)
22581|I am slowly grasping the full complexity of this. So we have (1) spatial and (2) temporal order and we have listing of editors per group (L,C,R) and of all editors (*). That make it 2x4. I wonder if we can achieve the grouping by typing. ala `editors` shows spatial or temporal order and the `editor left` keeps the order but does further filtering and likewise with another prefix for the other sort order.
22582|Agree with disablement. The icon could look more like a 3 horizontal line icon like:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22350/15506047/42799a98-21c6-11e6-9c64-11cf6d65e560.png)

Could it be the case that a ""legacy setting"" from a couple weeks ago was at fault and uninstalling VSCODE and reinstalling is a better choice than trying to find the setting that is ""stuck""?  (...or is there a ""restore factory defaults"" option in VSCODE?)"
22584|This is by design - we believe that the act of moving the editor indicates that the user intends to work with the editor. We also only support one preview editor in each group (that's part of the definition of a preview editor). So we couldn't drop a preview editor into a group already containing a preview editor and still persist it as a preview editor.
22585|Got broken somehow...
22586|cc @jrieken
22587|Duplicate of #6768
22588|Nothing is crashing. You're just getting log output from the crash service, which is a service that logs crashes. 👍   The problem here is that you are getting that output, when you shouldn't.  Can you change your user `PATH` and replace `%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Microsoft VS Code\` with `%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Microsoft VS Code\bin`, restart and try again?
22589|Duplicate of #6732
22590|Duplicate of #6761
22591|Ah good, the important part is that you close hidden editors :)
22592|How long until a solution for this?
22593|@jrieken well we do not show spatial order per group, and we do not show MRU order across all groups, so we have 1 spatial across all and 1 MRU per group. I like the idea of having a way to type into a group (e.g. `editors` to show all and `editors left` to search within a group). I would not think there is a strong use case for MRU order across all editors or spatial order within a group (for now at least).
22594|With what languages are you see this? When format stops working, are other features still doing fine? E.g. Code completion, hovers....
22595|@warpdesign Can you add a screenshot that shows where you would like to get that information?
22596|![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22350/15507816/5ec175ca-21cd-11e6-977c-45e5241ba58a.png)  As long as it shows in the product version, this is OK.
22597|Also noticed it and might be font related again.
22598|"@jrieken actually @joaomoreno was also confused by this but I am trying to mimic what a tab folder would do: the fact that an editor is in preview mode means that when you open another preview editor, we close the one you have first and then open the other one +1 to the right of the currently one (that is all ""tabs"" would open to the right of the currently active one).  In this case it looks weird because one preview editor closes from the end and the other opens to the side.  @stevencl @bgashler1 interested to hear your feedback here if you would expect the preview editor to move or stay at the position."
22599|Yes, intentional.
22600|This is likely because I am not aware of the fact that developer tools steel vertical space from me.
