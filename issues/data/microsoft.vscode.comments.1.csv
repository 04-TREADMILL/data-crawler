1|Looks easy enough!
2|:+1:
3|Will see what the problem is in gulp-symdest and then revert this.
4|I believe that's our build machine not running gulp the way I want it...
5|Duh, I simply did not compile. Invalid.
6|@jrieken seems to have fixed it yesterday. Reopen if I'm wrong.
7|`gulp-symdest` looks good. Wrote tests for it.
8|It looks like this is in 0.9 as well.  Still and issue, but not a blocker for 0.10.1.
9|related to [this commit](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/8f35cc4768393b25468416829e980d7550619fb1)...
10|This has been like that since day 1 and is currently blocked by https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/861
11|In general IntelliSense works for RC1 of ASP.NET v5. It appears to only fail in this scenario and feedback from the ASP.NET team suggests this is not a blocker for 0.10.1.
12|You should run the tests this way:  ``` cd vscode mocha ```
13|Actually I take that back. Let me look into this.
14|I can't reproduce. `./test/run.sh` works for me. Make sure you installed node dependencies.

21|It does! Thanks @joaomoreno. @aeschli the bug is then that only 2 quotes are put in.

28|I think the path is broken.
29|@joaomoreno can you help me out why the vscode.png ends up in the root of the zip instead of under the app folder? The fix is to put vscode.png under app/resources/linux in the same way how the welcome.md is already there.  The code to copy is:  ``` javascript es.merge(result, gulp.src(product.icons.application.png, { base: '.' })); ```
30|need to make sure we also update the fwlinks for the help menu and send a smile...
31|Need to update script to increase file open limit
32|Fixed, see #25, reviewed by Alex
33|Fixed by me, reviewed by Alex, see #25,

35|https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-distro/issues/1
36|Not a core Code issue, moving to here: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-distro/issues/2
37|did you run `./scripts/npm.sh install`?
38|Actually this is different and happens when using a non default dark theme.
39|I cannot reproduce on OSX. Talked to Dirk, this isn't something that is easily reproducible and is not a blocker for 0.10.1.
40|Fixed in 1de2c81
41|Seems like the output we get from git has changed.
42|Debugging this down, this is a regression. A change we did to vscode-textmate on Friday brings to light a issue in modeServiceImpl._getOrCreateMode: There we have a table of all created modes, as a table of promises. When there's no mode yet, a mode is created, the 'onLanguage' notification is fired and then the promise is set to the table. The text mate tokenizer listens the onLanguage mode and synchronously asks for the mode to add the tokenization support on. As the mode is not yet in the table, it will get a new one. Now we have two modes active. In the case of Javascript, the first one has the old legacy tokenizer, and seems to be the one used in the editor.  This has likely a bigger impact than just a wrong tokenization. We think we need to fix this.
43|Yes, this is a bug on the VSCode side. The issue seems to be that we only show the thread in the call stack once a stopped event has happened for that thread.  I can fix the issue but it requires testing so I propose to do it after connect event.
44|vscode-textmate issue: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-textmate/issues/7
45|That's an issue of the Kimbie Dark theme, which is not authored by us. Also the C# and the Java tokenizers are not ours. I guess you have to use a different theme for these languages instead
46|The toggle line comment does the following for languages which don't support line comments: - if there is any block comment on the line, it gets removed - if there is no block comment on the line, the line gets surrounded in a block comment.

80|I don't think `.gitignore` should dictate this, in other text editors it's normally done on a project setting or editor setting-level.
