20802|Same bug with java and c#
20803|"This is happening to me as well on Mac OS X.  When the error message starts appearing, clicking ""Continue"" on the message allows debugging to proceed normally (apparently the preLaunchTask, in my case a build step, actually worked fine).  In cases where the ""errors detected"" message appears on launch, there ARE errors listed at the bottom left of the VS Code window, but they don't appear to have been generated by my build preLaunchTask.    Instead, they are syntax errors that VS Code has found in an open editor file, unrelated to the preLaunchTask.  In my case, these errors were about the ""require"" call: [js] Cannot find name ""require""  The problem with launching only starts appearing after a file is opened in the editor that contains syntax errors (generating errors like the one above).  Closing the file does not clear the errors, and so all subsequent launches begin displaying the ""errors detected"" message.  The errors can be cleared by restarting VS Code, so perhaps that is why some people have reported that the launching problem often (temporarily) goes away after restarting."

20831|@jrieken why is the `this.telemetryService.isOptedIn` check not done inside the `this.telemetryAdapter.log`? Moving the responsibility of this check to the client looks error prone to me:  ``` if (this.telemetryAdapter && this.telemetryService.isOptedIn) {     this.telemetryAdapter.log(event.body.output, event.body.data); } ```  What is the use case where a `telemetryAdapter.log()` would **not** be guarded by a `telemetryService.isOptedIn`?
20832|"@isidorn  The preLaunchTask probably doesn't make sense to be a watching task.  But, to the point that @NinoFloris made, if the preLaunchTask exits with non-zero, then probably launch should not proceed (at least without warning prompt).  But, if it exits with zero, then just go.  Yes, if the preLaunchTask is a watching task (I suppose there could be a use case for that), then just have an launch.json option to indicate that the preLaunchTask is ""fire and forget"" or ""kill and restart""."

20847|Hi, I've modified the bug (deleted the .dll files) Can you please have a look at the one that remains?  Thanks!
20848|The problem is the generated tsconfig.json file. It contains a files section and list only two files main and typings.d.ts. Therefore the files under source aren't considered part of the project defined by the tsconfig.json file.   Removing the files section makes it work as expected. Opened https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/684.  I will also move this to the TS team since they should already issue an error on the first opened file in the src folder.
20849|This issue was moved to Microsoft/TypeScript#8523
20850|I could add information about whether a specific task run has generated problems. Then we would have the needed information. @isidorn as an alternative you could check how many errors existed before and after to see if the task added some.
20851|@bpasero I move that back to you. The strings need to have comments about the acceleration keys to use. There is little I can do from a localization point of view. Or am I missing something?
20852|@dbaeumer both approaches make sense to me. Also as @mattflix and @NinoFloris pointed out I could look into the exitCode of the [ITaskSummary](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/tasks/common/taskSystem.ts#L188) - should I get that reliably from the tasks framework?  If you decide to add the information then ping me once you push that and I can adopt on my side. Otherwise I can use the errorCode or the before/after idea.
20853|I will move this to the TS team which provide the tsserver.
20854|I believe that's a UX decision.
20855|This issue was moved to Microsoft/TypeScript#8524
20856|@isidorn can you start with the before after idea. Need to see what came in as new issues the last two weeks I was away.
20857|@srlim can you please share a small repository for which this can be reproduced. Can you share your `launch.json`. I suspect you are debugging node since that error happens in our node adapter, thus following to @weinand

20863|@bgashler1 yes I had something in mind like the first picture you attached. @chrisdias I understand the concern that you might want to click on that pause button, but once the user clicks once and figures it is only a state he will no longer try to click it imho. It looks like the other badges which are also not clickable.  I am fine with pushing this to the backlog and introducing it once we decide we want to move forward on making activity bar buttons be commands
20864|@gregvanl can not reproduce an code-alpha which contains a new version of the tsserver (in comparison of 1.0).
20865|@gregvanl can you give it another test with latest.
20866|"@pocesar can you please add the following setting to the workspace settings:  ```     ""typescript.tsserver.trace"": ""messages"" ```  Open the Output Window (Ctrl+Shift+U) and switch to the TypeScript channel.

20873|@srlim the error says that you are missing a 'program' attribute in your launch configuration. Please note that you cannot debug a node application running in docker by using a launch configuration of type 'launch' which uses the 'program' attribute. You will have to launch your node application in docker outside of VS Code and then use VS Code to 'attach' to the node running remotely in docker.
20874|@joaomoreno move the files to a new location. Since translations a scoped per file/folder location the files need to go through a translation cycle to get the menu translation back.
20875|@mathewmeconry are you able to share your project. Looking at you folder layout it should work.   Please be aware that VSCode has no support for filesGlob in tsconfig.json. However in your setup VS Code considers all ts files below the directory containing the tsconfig.json file as part of the project.
20876|@isidorn for now I'm returning the error as a dummy stack with one element:  ![2016-05-09 12-59-23](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1898161/15111222/ee01cd1e-15e5-11e6-9fd7-1b67717da633.png)  Please let me know if I can remove this workaround.
20877|This issue was moved to textmate/less.tmbundle#5
20878|@dopare I am not fully understanding why you can't have a build2 task having the additional argument.  @isidorn we could extend the task runner API so that you can pass additional arguments which a user specifies in launch.json. Not sure so if you want to do down that road.
20879|@isidorn please open a request if you want me to add the additional API.
20880|What you see is what's expected. The currently implemented folding strategy is based purely on the indentation of lines. A folding region starts when a line has a smaller indent than one or more following lines, and ends when there is a line with the same or smaller indent.  To be more smart and to, for example, understand tags, we will have to go one step further and introduce language agnostic folding regions. We have issue #3422 for this.
20881|Just tried the before / after and that approach breaks our extension development story. Since the marker service gets continously updated when developing TS, so the error would be present event before the preLaunchTask is run. Thus I could not use the heuristic since errors while developing TS extensions would be undetected by debug. Thus it would be cool if the task framwork gave me more data.  I have started to look into the exitCode and if present and 0 I just start debugging @NinoFloris @mattflix our alpha channel should be open to public soon so you will be able to just try it out and let me know how it works for you
20882|@aeschli assigning to you since this is a grammar thing. However I think we should close this one since css inside JS is to my knowledge not valid.
20883|@dbaeumer I do not want to go down that road. I was just not fully sure if we support the scenario @dopare is requsting using a build2 task. Since you say we do I am closing this, since this request cant be done by adding an additional task in the `tasks.json` and referencing that task in `preLaunchTask`
20884|"@isidorn I have simple task which is automatically generated by coreclr debugger, changing the name of that task results an exception  ``` {     ""version"": ""0.1.0"",     ""command"": ""dotnet"",     ""isShellCommand"": true,     ""args"": [],     ""tasks"": [         ... ,         {             ""taskName"": ""build2"",             ""args"": [""some arguments""],             ""isBuildCommand"": true,             ""problemMatcher"": ""$msCompile""         }     ] } ```  this says `No executable found matching command ""dotnet-build2""`"

20889|+1 I had a similar issue (non existing compiler option) and I didn't get why my configured target=es6 got not accepted. Interestingly, it worked when compiling over command line but it failed when compiling over tsserver. See also the [related](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/src/server/editorServices.ts#L1239) TS compiler code. Maybe one could get that error from tsserver back to VS code?

20891|> Moving the responsibility of this check to the client looks error prone to me:  Yes and when using the actual service it's good, but in the debug error telemetry case the service isn't used but just the shared node lib - which doesn't know about configuration
