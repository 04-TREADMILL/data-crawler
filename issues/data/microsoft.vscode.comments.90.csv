8901|Is it also possible that we keep variable refactor within the function scope instead of the whole file?
8902|@isidorn Are you sure this is ok? The action should only be enabled if the intersection between the editor selection and the changes is not empty.  Reopening for discussion.
8903|:+1:
8904|I mension this in #2828 as well, and I also hope the color for variables comes back in dark theme.
8905|OK. Where you you define your custom `%path%` and `%prompt%`?  Do you maybe run Code as another user, ie Administrator?  Code simply [reads the `%comspec%` variable and spawns that](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/ce6b458166c1021f3a0a9f22f6bd5d0ae9c535bd/src/vs/base/node/processes.ts#L79). What is in your `%comspec%`?
8906|@Tyriar :+1:   Thanks for the PR, @jamesqo
8907|I want Open Folder, not Open File
8908|That's work as open folder if you don't select any file or select a folder.
8909|@mkosieradzki Good catch, I think we miss 'integer' support also at other places. I have to make a pass through the JSON parser.
8910|Nope. I can't open folder. It's just keep opening file picker dialog until I choose a file
8911|Ah, of course if you want own option in the language dropdown, then having your own id is the right thing to do. Highlighting is off: Sounds like an issue in the grammar, or a bug in our TextMate engine. Did you check the console in the dev tools?
8912|@bgashler1 let's discuss this in our ux sync today
8913|@bingzheyuan You are asking for deeper PHP support with real language understanding. It's not something we, the core VS Code team, will be able to provide. We lack deeper PHP knowledge and the resources. We are actually hoping someone from the community would be interested of implementing a more sophisticated PHP extension.

8916|Great! But I think it's still better to make it default option :dancer:
8917|@csholmq Thanks for this info. Yes, with a plugin you can do this in Eclipse (but it is not the default behaviour of Eclipse debugging). I think that it should be possible to do something similar in VS Code after we've opened up the debugger front end for extensions.  CC @isidorn
8918|@bpasero fyi
8919|fyi @aeschli
8920|@elprogrammer I'm not 100% sure what you mean. Is it that you'd want the JavaScript language service to discover node modules installed in your project and offer intellisense for them?
8921|This worked for me when I tried Salsa, @egamma -- maybe a configuration problem?
8922|There's also https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2867 suggesting to take MagicPython. Did give this a try? (There's already a MagicPython extension)
8923|@BazIdle OmniSharp will continue to move forward and it is now in the best hands (the team that also works on Roslyn). The work on Omnisharp for vscode is now tracked in https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode.   Your issue from above is now also tracked there OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn#371.  FYI @DustinCampbell
8924|We now have two built-in dark themes:  - the Dark Visual Studio that follows the color scheme of Visual Studio. It has no color for variables - the Dark+ that is more colorful, including light blue for variables. It is now the new default, but needs to be configured manually by users that are updating from the January update.   Same with the light themes.
8925|@stkb I've installed it and had a play. Works nicely! Thank you very much; one happy customer here.
8926|@benquarmby I could reproduce the same behaviour with node-inspector, so this is not a VS Code problem but a node problem, most likely a duplicate of https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4917.  It does not occur with node version < 4.2.6
8927|@SamVerschueren @philipgiuliani @nchammas I am sorry, this looks horrible.  I cannot reproduce on a vanilla (no extensions) 0.10.8 on Windows. ![tab-sql](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5047891/12943498/fdc55b02-cfe1-11e5-8dc6-e466dbe55a00.gif)  ![tab-text](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5047891/12943532/3e486caa-cfe2-11e5-9ea9-de4fdb36607e.gif)  I will try shortly on the mac
8928|Indeed, might be related to Mac.
8929|"@SamVerschueren Do you have any extensions installed that might hijack the tab key? i.e. just to be sure the built-in command executes, can you please add the following to the end of your `keybindings.json`:  ``` { ""key"": ""tab"", ""command"": ""tab"", ""when"": ""editorTextFocus && !editorTabMovesFocus"" } ```"
8930|did aeschli even attempt to understand what is going on here?
8931|I even posted before and after shots.
8932|We're using the perl grammar from https://github.com/textmate/perl.tmbundle which seems to be more current than to what you point. I'd suggest to file your request to https://github.com/textmate/perl.tmbundle.Alternatively you could also create your own extension that brings in the grammar from https://github.com/caipre/sublime-languages. Check out https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/tools/yocode.and create an extension from the grammar you prefer. The perl language id is 'perl'
8933|yall need to assign a new guy to this. aeschli is fighting for some reason. closed another report I opened claiming its not true even when I had before and after screenshots.
8934|The lint error message is: 'property declarations' can only be used in a .ts file. (property) SearchProfileList.propTypes: {     list: any;     getSearchProfileList: any;     deleteSearchProfile: any;     editSearchProfile: any;     location: any;  Nette Grüsse nach Wollishofen :)
8935|Added that but still the same behaviour.  Switched to the insider build and removed all the extensions I had installed over there (just to make sure) but still the same.
8936|@gregg-miskelly VS Code now listens on breakpoint events with reason `update` and updates the verification state and location.
8937|@waderyan And how does the community give feedback to that Wiki? E.g. when a plugin exists or has had its behavior altered.
8938|Ok I reverted my change. @jacek-dargiel do you have exact reproducable steps, since it is hard for us to repro this. If not I will keep an eye open since I know it happens seldomly
8939|"OK so I tried in a new empty project folder with almost empty code user settings.json.  1st I tried the old intellisense with Salsa env var renamed to disable it I find even the typescript based intellisense is not working.   What am I not understanding?  test,js  <pre> var p = require('path'); var c = p. console. </pre>  jsconfig.json  <pre> {     ""compilerOptions"": {         ""target"": ""ES6"",         ""module"": ""commonjs""     } } </pre>  I get autocomplete suggestions for console once I have a package.json, presumably as code can then infer the correct context. However, I get no suggestions for p?  I have node 4.2.6 installed on Windows 10 What else effects the intellisense?"
8940|Right you are. I notice Node JS Tools for Visual Studio repros this bug also. Definitely a node problem and not VS Code specific.
8941|This issue is present in this case too: When I have a function defined as `var testFunction = function() {}`  Here is a screenshot with the issue: [http://imgur.com/wS66ROM](http://imgur.com/wS66ROM)
8942|Oh, this is quite strange, yesterday I couldn't get it to work at all, the option was disabled all the time no matter what I did or how I made the selection. Today it works just fine.
8943|Yeah it is funky, please keep an eye open and let us know if you see some pattern
8944|@bpasero I discussed that in length with @alexandrudima  and @egamma and I understand the history of the change. But the current behavior is very unexpected. The long term solution is for sure to have more extensions handle a file type and let the user decide which one he wants to use. In the short term we might the firstLine rule be combined with an extension. For the shebang we can say that the file must not have an extension to make that rule win.
8945|I'm assuming I don't need to install any typings as node is directly supported. It should just work out of the box.
8946|"I still cannot reproduce. Can you think of anything else I might be doing differently? Do you have other settings for VSCode or maybe a different keyboard layout, etc...

8947|Thanks for reporting. The problem is in the user setting declaration. If null is a valid settings value, it also needs to be declared in the schema. Not sure why we haven't seen this before. I fixed it for the php, typescript and git settings. Creating a follow-up bug against go.
8948|This is a duplicate of Microsoft/vscode-docs#145
8949|@gregg-miskelly after discussing with @dbaeumer we think it is best that we help the user generate `tasks.json` file. We can not move the task running logic inside the `launch.json` since then we would have to replicate all the tasks logic into debug.  Is the task that you want to run a `preLaunchTask`, or would the user want to run it independent of debug?
8950|This is odd.   I installed a new fresh version of the latest insider build. Removed my `Application Support/Code - Insiders` directory to make sure I don't have any setting specified.

8956|Sorry, but you still need to intstall the node.d.ts file, this hasn't changed between pre-salsa and Salsa JS support.   Closing this issue - automatic fetching of typings is high on the backlog of Salsa.

8997|I see in your screenshot that you are using ES7 bind operator which is not yet supported by TypeScript which powers Salsa. As a consequence you get syntax errors and red squiggles which can make Intellisense fail.  In the second screenshot you are correct that the React-Component could be proposed first, but the React-Component is proposed so Intellisense is working but the sorting isn't optimal.  Moving over to TypeScript as an FYI.

8999|Here's a video demonstrating Notepad++, Atom, VS2015 and VSCode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZdm1v3AUjE  Every editor apart from VSCode shown in the video places the caret at the start of the next line when selecting a line via the line numbers. VSCode doesn't do this which not only makes deleting lines very irritating, but also doesn't let you copy and paste lines with the standard Ctrl+C Ctrl+V.
