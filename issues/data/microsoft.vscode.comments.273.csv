27203|"Even if we go with ""item"" instead of ""file"" and don't change ""editor"" to ""editorgroup"" that only saves 8 breaking changes (ex. focusFirstEditor, etc). Given that ""editor"" doesn't show up often in the UI, ""editor"" is probably fine and accurate enough (ignoring readonly cases).  We'll need to be careful to correctly call out ""editor"" and ""editor groups"" in commands and try to leave other commands generic (for example: I think we should change ""Keep Editor"" to ""Keep Open"" https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8026)."

27209|@bpasero I haven't had any crashes in the past few days either, just like @tjsail33. So I'm not sure if something in one of the updates had fixed the issue or not. When it was happening in was not just one particular file or file type that was causing it to crash. If it happens again, I'll report back.  I'll leave it to you as to whether you want to close this issue or not, I'm fine either way.

27227|Yeah, activity bar could be smaller imho for what it provides. Basically all icons we use are pretty much 4 years old I would say, a general face lift might be cool to bring them all in sync.

27238|Thanks @alrra !
27239|@gregvanl Another usecase where user wants to toggle focus between editor and Problems view (or other views in bottom) - While fixing problems or debugging its most common to navigate between editor and views. Currently, you would need to toggle the view twice to get this.
27240|I assume this is with Razor.
27241|-1 for this proposal - I personally do not think it is adding value for the output and debug panel. The users are already used to the current behavior and changing that might break their muscle memory.  As Ben pointed out giving the focus to the output does not make much sense also. If you disagree then we should bring this item up on the next ux meeting.
27242|Then it is a dup of https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/4526 which needs to be fixed in the TS support we use.
27243|@paulvanbrenk thanks for the PR.
27244|This is a TS server issues tracked here: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/7762 and will be fixed in the next tsserver release.  If this is blocking for you, you can try to use the tsserver from the TS nightly build which already contains a fix for this. See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript#_using-newer-typescript-versions on how to do this.
27245|I am not a gulp expert but to my knowledge gulp doesn't replace {{file}} with a real file name. How would gulp know which file to take.  However, what you can do is to use ${file} inside the tasks.json to pass the current open file to gulp. See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_variable-substitution for examples and which variables are available.

27260|@joaomoreno hmm at the same time we looked into this issue - I pushed a font-size 16px which I prefer over the small button - feel free to revert that
27261|You need to put the ${file} in the tasks.json file as an arg to your gulp tasks.
27262|and inside gulp i should get the process argv then i guess right ?
27263|@joaomoreno Do we have marketplace guy on GitHub? We've seen a lot of issues complaining the extension installation failure/slowness from China. Do they have any monitoring or reports for it? We may need some enhancement for marketplace like what people do for Windows or VS.
27264|@dbaeumer  it doesnt work the file is passed to gulp not not to my script so gulp ties to run it as a task so thats not an option and vscode fails about gulp tasks seems while using gulp tasks tasks.json file is totally useless
27265|i figured out i could use `--env` but its still a trick i thought if i run gulp through vscode it would auto replace all those special variables inside gulpfile

27273|@LarryWeiss With the german keyboard, while I do have the same default keymapping configuration as you have, I get the following using your steps:  ![vscode_zoom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8385202/16299530/20ac9640-393b-11e6-83ee-0980e1c7877c.png)  The actual working keymapping is [Ctrl +], as advertised in the menus and the command palette.  This is imho the proper mapping for the german keyboard, since [Ctrl =] would require a very awkward shift-key combination.  Funny though as this is not what is configured in keymapping, there might be some locale-specific adjustment voodoo going on here?

But it finds ""Something"" just fine.  **Edit** I believe someone has designed Ctrl+T this way, but I can't understand why, having exported global values in symbols would be advantageous for navigation etc. If this is implemented: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/188 the Ctrl+T could be used as primary GUI for importing a selected symbol, but it can't be used if it doesn't include all symbols."

27294|There is no proxy to configure. The firewall sits as the default gateway and decrypts the https traffic and resigns it with its certificate (that is issued by our domains CA that is trusted by all domain computers). It appears that vscode is either either ignoring the results because it doesn't trust the cert, or the firewall is blocking the check. I don't believe it's the firewall as the logs indicate nothing is blocked. Where does vscode look for updates?

27296|Nice thoughts! - `onDidChangeModelRawContent` - we can probably remove those immediately - `IHTMLContentElement` vs `MarkedString` - +1 - definitely something to do. But only if we eliminate `IHTMLContentElement` from our codebase. I would not go for adaptor funny business. Do you wanna do it? - the model hierarchy comes from our codebase. Things are empty because the methods are marked internal. the .d.ts is not designed, it is generated. I can probably remove a couple of interfaces in there, but yes, there is a distinction between IReadOnlyModel and IModel (probably the most useful).
27297|`vscode-update.azurewebsites.net` is the domain it connects to.
27298|That's probably why we haven't whitelisted it. I'll try setting: http.proxyStrictSSL first, then ask our networking team to whitelist the domain. Will report back.
27299|Thanks!
27300|I can look at 'IHTMLContentElement'. Probably I won't be able to eliminate it all together, but replace the occurrences in Hover and IModelDecorationOptions with MarkedString to it doesn't appear in monaco.d.ts anymore
