6401|@stevencl great, that discussion covers my issues. I'm closing this one.
6402|After using Cloud9 IDE online and then switching to Visual Studio Code for offline work makes you realise the importance of this feature. Will it be available in the future?
6403|Probably a duplicate of https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/508
6404|Feels like this would be like hitting the problem with a big hammer instead trying to fix the root cause. Some potential things that could be looked in to instead: - reducing memory usage - plugging leaks - making it easier to find leaks and memory hogs - periodic clean up without reloading? - writing about extension development best practices  It would also not work for some users: - those who typically have unsaved files in their workspace for long periods of time (me) - users who don't idle for 10+ minutes before there's a problem  Plus extensions could get in to a bad state as @jrieken mentions.
6405|"I don't know why i can't upload any file and GitHub tells me ""Something went really wrong......"" The structure of the project :  css   --xxx.css   --xxx.css    .... img   --xxx.jpg   --xxx.png   .... xxx.js  *6 xxx.html  *2  The process of VS code which takes much memory takes much CPU."
6406|"@isidorn, what do you think of `#795E26` (**_Second Proposal**_ below) instead?  I think this is a good balance.  It correlates with the dark theme's color, but it's much more crisp and has a much stronger contrast ratio.  <img width=""629"" alt=""color proposal 2"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11839736/12342377/bae3e37a-bade-11e5-97c7-1ba3f4441ead.png"">"
6407|@jrieken  could you please use the screenshot to  tell me the detail steps how to do it ,thank you!!!
6408|Totally agree on @xeoneux :+1: . If one just wants the identifier, it is just one backspace away. I have been quite annoyed by this also. It seems like the autocomplete suggests me a variable and not a function or method.
6409|@dubeg currently not, the algorithm lives here: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/base/common/scorer.ts  Even with adding something like a boost for distance, this is a tricky case because we also want to match on camel case expressions (first character of a word matching).  I wonder if the fuzzy algorithm needs to be different when matching against natural words compared to matching against a file path.
6410|"> Looking at the Windows Task Manager does not show it using any more memory at this time (it peaks at around 38MB  Add the ""Commit Size"" column and check that. The default memory column is only private working set."
6411|:+1:
6412|We have experimented with different options in the past. Currently we defer it to the language service. CC @jrieken.
6413|looks like a small workspace. are those very large files?
6414|for TypeScript this should still be supported with the `useCodeSnippetsOnMethodSuggest` setting
6415|The largest file is a js file , 103KB
6416|@bpasero There's a better color on the way. Please comment in #1943 for the tuning of colors.
6417|"I'm sorry, I'm really not sure why [line 5](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/scripts/npm.bat#L5) doesn't seem to work for you.

I'll close this issue since it is a Command Prompt issue and you seem to be the only person that actually hit it.

6418|@dubeg Don't call it from the `scripts` directory, but from the root of the repository.

6420|@tht13 there is quite some documentation around. The is a getting started documentation here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/example-language-server and the TypeScript API code here https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node has JSDoc comments.

6423|@btroncone: how does the tsconfig.json file look like. Could it be that the other file is not covered by the tsconfig.json file since you use a files section
6424|795E26 looks good to me, I updated the code
6425|Looks like the build failed due to an error in getting oniguruma.
6426|It would also be nice to be able to specify arguments for commands in keybindings.
6427|It's maybe the extended type hinting that PHP7 provide.
6428|Yeah, #508
6429|Could 'module' have same color as 'class' or 'interface' ? I would love that ....

6430|@bpasero Sorry, I'm having trouble reproducing again. I think I had a stray git repo in an earlier attempt, that wasn't included in the archive above. I'll let you know when I have more concrete results.  Would be really helpful if it were possible to open multiple independent instances... being limited to one test a night is quite slow. Do you happen to carry across the Chromium flags for separate profiles?
6431|"It is possible to build multiple Code versions that can run in parallel, though we have not documented it. If you change the values in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/product.json so that they are different and then build from the command line, you can start multiple distinct instances. The identifiers that have to be unique are: - darwinBundleIdentifier - win32MutexName - nameShort - nameLong - dataFolderName (e.g. ""dataFolderName"": "".oss-code-1"")"
6432|Agreed. Too big of a hammer.
6433|@CaiusTSM Can you please provide steps?
6434|I see this is now marked as a duplicate, but just to follow up from @Elusive138, I've now added the commit size to the task manager and I see it does increase over time (regardless of whether I'm using Code or not). It's currently at 300MB and rising. Code has only had a little use this morning.
6435|"@danlofquist, I'm trying to follow your instructions as I have this problem on OSX.  `dnvm list` gives ""-bash: dnvm: command not found"" ... What to do?"

6452|Windows 8.1. In Code, opened a folder for a git repository containing 39,000 files in the morning. Did very little with it, a few small edits in a couple of files. By the end of the day the Commit Size reported by Task Manager was 672,164K.  It grew steadily all day, even when I wasn't in the program.

6461|"Yep! Using OSX 10.10.5, 2.5 GHz i7 w/16GB RAM. I usually have 2 windows open, one that has a Javascript folder open, and the other with a Ruby on Rails folder open. 90% of my work happens in Javascript though. Individual files aren't that large averaging at I would say 500 LOC. However is a very large number of files within the folders and I tend to search for files a lot. I leave my windows open so I don't free memory.  What I meant by laggy was that things go unresponsive for a few seconds before spewing everything in the buffer. I could type a few words and nothing would appear on screen nor would the cursor blink. A few seconds all my words would appear suddenly and this repeats. This is the same for other actions such as scrolling.  I'm attaching a few screen captures if it helps any. Cheers.

6462|Beautiful, thanks!
6463|Oh I see... this is because the folder itself is a different git repository.
6464|I personally have issues trying to determine where to start tearing apart the example because of how compact it is in a minimal number of files. If the purpose is to teach, the structure of the vscode-go project separating the different features of the language support features into separate files (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/tree/master/src) does a better job. If the example project did the same thing, it would help a bunch.  The downfall of the vscode-go project is that it lends it's functionality to other tooling written in Go instead of keeping it in the extension. I think the example project does a great job covering all of the features, but it's a bit intimidating today to grok.
6465|It's not related but i'm just curious to know how do you capture your gifs? I capture the screen with Quicktime and then convert that to gif. Is there any better solution (direct / 1 phase) for that?
6466|I use [LiceCap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/)
6467|Maybe. But the shared process uses `cp.fork`, which shouldn't really fail like that.
6468|I can help with Indonesian
6469|I was having this exact problem. Closing GitHub Desktop and running the config command did nothing for me. I started backtracking and remembered that I had recently added a simple .gitattributes file.  Most of the file was simply comments, and once I removed it and followed the instructions above once again, things started working. Every time I open the desktop app, it breaks again. But at least the aforementioned fix works as long as I don't add this file to the project.  ``` # # Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization # *        text=auto #  # *.cs     text diff=csharp # *.java   text diff=java # *.html   text diff=html # *.css    text # *.js     text # *.sql    text #  # *.csproj text merge=union # *.sln    text merge=union eol=crlf #  # *.docx   diff=astextplain # *.DOCX   diff=astextplain #  # # absolute paths are ok, as are globs # /**/postinst* text eol=lf #  # # paths that don't start with / are treated relative to the .gitattributes folder # relative/path/*.txt text eol=lf  * text=auto ```  Looks like the age old battle between \n & \r\n has returned to bite us once again ;) JK, I don't know if it's related. But that is the only thing this settings file should have affected.
6470|It's that hard adding one key into the config? :-1:  Okay.
6471|Yes we are aware of it but currently have no plans to use it.
6472|@gushie any chance this repo can be shared with me? also, what was the initial memory reported?
6473|Why would having the file offer a conflict if the issue is just credentials? Is it because it is a conflict with the rules within VS Code (LF / CRLF). This is very confusing, but it does make sense. I did not have this file.   Is the solution to make VS Code sensitive to this file for it's GIT Implementation?
6474|Also, [Brackets](http://brackets.io) has colorpicker, which is nice.
6475|@bpasero I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to share the repo itself but if there are any details about it that might help, excluding the file contents themselves, let me know. The process initially starts at around 110MB, quickly grows to about 130MB before settling back to 90MB. It will then grow steadily from this point forward. (There are 5 other code.exe processes which vary from 4MB to 30MB but these don't noticably grow. There is only the one Code Window)  I don't know what the final Commit Size was from yesterday as the process had crashed when I returned to it today.
6476|"@gushie I've been using Performance Monitor on the code.exe processes to monitor the ""Private Size"".  Pretty annoying that we can't share the workspaces we have issues with! I wonder if anyone's encountered this with something open-source. Looking for similarities: was your repo ever used with git-svn?  @bpasero Thanks, if the process I left hasn't repro'd when I get back in on Monday, I might try building a couple additional copies. Would need to figure out how to keep track of which one's which, though.. that might be a problem."
6477|@Elusive138 We use Atlassian tools, so SourceTree connecting to a private Stash server
6478|Ah, that's completely different from mine. Was a local Git repo (w/ Git Extensions) connecting to an SVN server. My current test is with a git repo based off the vscode one... hopefully that'll repro and I can share it.
6479|"May not be related at all, really. One this is pretty clear, when VSCode sends credentials manually via a prompt (in Windows only?), it simply doesn't work. So the easiest way to fix it is to eliminate the prompt, and that is what the command above seems to do. I did see some strange formatting in the git settings file too, but it may be unrelated. This is a file that seems to get touched when you open github desktop though.  ``` git config --global --e ```  Opens the following file for me..(noticed multiple credential headings)  ``` [user]         name = djabr..         email = <redacted> [filter ""lfs""]         clean = git-lfs clean %f         smudge = git-lfs smudge %f         required = true [credential] [credential] [credential]         helper = wincred ```"

6490|+1 I've been pretty much ignoring my errors and warnings in VSCode in hopes that this would be addressed soon but it's been a few months now. I've also noticed some discussion in the ESLint project about this and their suggestion was to make use of babel-eslint. I wonder if that is possible to use in VSCode...

6495|When the areas between the lines are transparent, then you cannot click in these areas, which is not desirable.  CC @weinand does this violate Apple's design guide lines?  @bgashler1 fyi.
6496|"The HIG says this about icons on OS X: ""Use transparency when it makes sense. Transparency in an icon can help depict glass or plastic, but it can be tricky to use convincingly.""
