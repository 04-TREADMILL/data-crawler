28901|This should be fixed for June if possible, I always use quotes here and it feels very broken. This bug could also potentially have other implications for code completion providers. Please comment @aeschli
28902|This is what it looks like when accessing via <kbd>alt</kbd>, notice the misplaced underline.  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2193314/16535855/d9dd5c16-3f9f-11e6-91ce-b19cd1fa8430.png)
28903|This has been bothering me as well. I've been thinking I'd like to try hacking on something and this doesn't seem so bad. I would have time over the weekend of the 9th. Mind if I pick this up then if it hasn't already been done @alexandrudima @bpasero?
28904|Not a regression (also in 1.2.1).
28905|"Nice work @bpasero. Unfortunately, I can't think of a simple way around the inheritance problem.  But it really didn't bother me because I can't drag a tab to the ""Open Editors"" anyway, which is where that blue color was used for list items that have active focus.  Some of the more complex solutions I suggested earlier, such as CSS custom properties, and the CSS 4 pollyfill library would certainly enable us to avoid using the mix-blend mode though and avoid the inheritance problem."
28906|From my experience, this is highly dependant on one's mouse setup. ~~Most mice I have seen have the default setup has those mouse buttons mapped to the keys: `alt+left`, `alt+right` for `back`, and `forward` respectively.~~  **Edit: I just realized that Windows actually emits a dedicated _virtual key code_  for those buttons, Usually named something to the effect of `VK_BROSWER_BACK` this is what `vscode` listens for, not `alt+left`... by default that is...**  I have a [Logitech G7000s](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g700s-rechargeable-wireless-gaming-mouse) which has 8 buttons addition button. Logitech ships it with software that lets you map what happens when you press a key. I would check your mouse's manufacture to see what they have available. If there's nothing of use/usable on your OS, there's a bunch of software out there to help you do it manually.  Having switched to Linux a month or so back, I had the fun experience of using `xbindkeys` to listen for the mouse button to be pressed, and then using `xte` to emit the corresponding series of _virtual keystrokes_.
28907|If the status bar is what distracts you from developing, maybe you have other issues?  I'm cool with the color. Blue in 'normal' conditions, orange-red in debug mode. Works for me.
28908|> If the status bar is what distracts you from developing, maybe you have other issues?   I'll take passive aggressive responses for 100, Alex.
28909|Not passive aggressive.   Out of all the things to complain about in an IDE, the status bar at the bottom? Not bugs, lack of features to assist in more efficient development, language support, better debugging or GIT integration, lack of community, etc... (not saying VSC has these issues) but.. the color of the status bar at the bottom?
28910|"I find this issue is not belong to VSC, it is a bug of amVim. if uninstall amVim, this issue will disappear. @Yukaii  @Elderry  @alexandrudima  I have submit an new issue to amVim https://github.com/aioutecism/amVim-for-VSCode/issues/109  Maybe next time besides ""VSCode Version"" and ""OS Version"" we should also let others know what packages we have installled. @alexandrudima"
28911|@natdm Well, guess what, UI does matter in an IDE/editor. If it were only for the features you mentioned above, we'd all be using vim/emacs
28912|idea was being able to run open file tests just like all other IDEs, this way I have to constantly edit launch.json when working on tests.
28913|Same here: Ubuntu 16.04 , VS 1.3.0-insider , C# extension 1.2.1
28914|@weinand  First, I switched to VSCode recently and just love it, great work guys!  I'm having pretty similar problems with the latest vscode, the breakpoint just won't match for me. I built a sample repo here to help you reproduce the issue. Would be much appreciated if you can point me where I did wrong. It would be awesome to be able to setup the workflow this way.  https://github.com/zjaml/vscode-mocha-issue/tree/master  Thanks
28915|eagerly waiting for this ... üê±
28916|I can reproduce on Mac.
28917|@Serjster if you are on stable (blue icon) you get updates once per month, on insider (green icon) you get updates once per day. Maybe you are on the green VS Code icon.
28918|Ah ok, sorry about that...
28919|No nothing changed as far as I know, but feel free to investigate and PR me if you found something.
28920|If this can be fixed by tweaking our CSS with some rules for CJK, we are good. Otherwise the bigger story is to support setting font from a setting. Moving to Brad first to see if we can fix this with some CJK CSS rules in the same way we do it here https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/electron-browser/media/shell.css#L20
28921|@bgashler1 well you can drag it over to any opened editor and there you would get the large area filled in blue. I will see if I can tweak the color at least a little bit in light theme.
28922|@kieferrm thanks. please also update the tests, otherwise our builds are failing (https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode/builds/141740263)
28923|@Luncher can you be more specific?
28924|The build should not fail because windows-mutext is an optional dependency. @Luncher do you have NPM 3 running?
28925|I am very sorry to hear you are having issues with VS Code. I wonder if this issue is being caused by an installed extension. Can you try to run VS Code without extensions? From the command line, execute: `code --disable-extensions` and try your steps again to see if it reproduces. If you see it is an issue with the extension, please file it against the extension repository itself.
28926|Yes, we currently do not support this scenario, sorry.
28927|That is weird indeed. Since the working files list is removed in our upcoming 1.3 release I wonder if you could give our insider build a try?  We are releasing preview releases of the next stable VS Code version for everyone to try and give feedback. These preview releases are not 100% tested and might be unstable but contain our latest features and bugfixes. You can give our preview releases a try from: http://code.visualstudio.com/Download#insiders
28928|Fixed for 1.3 release.
28929|@ahmetalpbalkan did you open this file before? we keep and restore the view state of the file as it was so maybe you had been scrolling to the end before? or do you change monitor resolutions often maybe?
28930|I do not think we (or JS) supports this syntax.
28931|"I am very sorry to hear you are having issues with VS Code. Reading your description it seems that the issue originates from an extension and not VS Code itself.

28932|Note that currently we only support these buttons on Windows. There they are bound to navigating in the history.
28933|@mfrost66 we do not store any view state when you open an empty instance, only when you open a folder. I am marking this as duplicate, there are issues filed for this already.

28935|I think we just have not yet made a NLS input.
28936|Not a regression I think. We just reload the contents each time.
28937|I think this is a general problem with actions inside trees.   @kieferrm do you see this bug in all trees with actions? if so, we should only have one issue for it.
28938|I filed a similar bug that the list widget needs to be on par with tree widget in terms of these accessibility features.

28941|It's 2016, just make a 64 bit version :D
28942|I think I found something that should help with this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-sudo It allows to run a process with privileged rights, cross-platform, by opening a platform-dependend prompt. You could save all unsaved files in the temporary folder, then use electron-sudo to restart Code as admin, and re-open and save the unsaved files (I assume this is how Notepad++ does it).

28949|Is it possible to configure VSCode for using the integrated terminal when selecting the option 'Open in terminal' in the folder explorer? It seems it is just a matter of performing a _cwd_ and activating the terminal pane.
28950|That is true. I did an input on Friday and it takes a week to get them localized. In general our statement is that Insider and Milestones builds partly show English strings because of the time delay of localization.   Moving to @sandy081 to ensure that the strings are proper localized. If so please close.

28962|Sass is a very good choice, especially in strict compliance with the CSS syntax.  We may need to pay attention to avoid excessive nesting of the selector. Then you can also introduce Autoprefixer to automatically generate the prefix, now there are too many do not need the prefix.

28968|I do both. It's easy to repro actually even without changing the resolution or anything as apparently vscode restores the view state. In this case, restoring a not-very-useful view state sounds a bit weird to me is all.

28971|I started noticing this issue happening about 3 weeks ago with my system. I get similar black squares as you other people reported but only in Chrome and VS Code, no other applications seems to have the issue. I only have 1 instance of VS Code open with a Node.JS project and my RAM usage is only at 25-40% while the black squares are happening. Any ideas what else to try?
