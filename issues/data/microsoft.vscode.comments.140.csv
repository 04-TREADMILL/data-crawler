13906|@contreras-jorgev  Sorry, I wasn't clear Salsa fully supports node module resolution and it is more robust than it was before. Commonjs is the default module type, but I still recommend that you create a jsconfig.json, then you can easily leverage .d.ts files to get Intellisense for existing node modules. Pls see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/runtimes/nodejs.

13909|Awesome, thanks a lot for making that change Alex!  It seems like this behavior should come automatically with no extra work on my side, correct?
13910|Duplicate of https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2192
13911|This is coming in the upcoming release along with deb and rpm package files. If you're interested the file used is https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/resources/linux/code.desktop
13912|This will also address #3803, where users have had trouble seeing where the left edge of the code editor is and where subsequent tabs are (especially with smaller tab sizes).

13921|Tried the insiders code today. While I do think the column selection behavior is a major improvement over previous behavior IMHO the lack of virtual space is limiting the use. Will look if there's an issue for this.
13922|@mohsen1 is F1 > Reload Window also slow? because if yes, we could do some profiling.
13923|Discoverability of keyboard shortcuts could be improved potentially here and certainly elsewhere.  I favor @stevencl approach of helping users discover these shortcuts in the context of where they could be relevant, and applying this to other areas of the product.  This is an experience we should design that could help users improve their productivity and ease of use throughout the product.  @anseki, I noticed that Atom and Sublime do not include your requested feature by default, but they are installable through optional packages/extensions.  To @bpasero's point, I think an extension makes perfect sense for people who would really like to see this particular feature.  How hard would it be to get this API?
13924|Can you check whether you have tsdk  defined in your user settings. This was required to enable Salsa in January.  Notice the commandline tsc version has nothing to do with this. Code ships with a version of tsc.

13932|@bpasero yes, the zip doesn't contain the launcher. I'm wondering whether we should even ship the zip at all anymore since the deb and rpm files are just archives, including everything in the zip plus more. See https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-website/issues/73#issuecomment-195578442

13952|As said we will loose auto detection of Jake if we remove it. And I doubt that the .sln workspace all use task :-). I also agree that the description doesn't add a lot of value but it makes the dialog look nicer. Why do we have to optimize for the number of entries in the list. I have for example an request to add an entry for npm as well. And if we allow extension to contribute to it we don't have control over the list anyways.   Don't get me wrong I am in for a good in the box expierence. I simply don't see why making the list as short as possible and moving everything to the docs helps with that.
13953|Salsa formatter. Moving.

13968|@mrmckeb afaik this is just exploratory and we're not committing to anything yet. The main concern of most people seems to be wasted effort in building out this when it's not adding any new real functionality, just an alternate UX. It could also potentially be more confusing have two different editors for the same thing.  Extensions are another beast which would probably need to be handled quite differently. I created an issue for that too https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3356
13969|"At the end of the day what I want to do is help customers be successful while keeping the product consistent and streamlined.  I'm making a couple of assertions to achieve this goal.  First, we have clear data that indicates jake usage is extremely low. So low in fact that the presence of Jake in the list only adds what I will call ""noise"" to the list. It doesn't help the vast majority of people be successful and it doesn't keep the product streamlined. This issue is about removing Jake from the list, but I assert we should remove the jake detection logic from the code base as well.  More code means more bug opportunities (does anyone test for Jake, are there new versions, do we have to fix bugs here, etc.) and more download and code loading size.  Every bit counts.  Second, I don't see having multiple TypeScript entries provides enough value to keep all of them in the list. The difference between each type of TypeScript task is very subtle, in some cases it is simply an additional parameter. Having documentation that discusses why you would want one or the other option would be much more valuable than having four subtly different entries in the list, which is why I suggested to update the docs. Also, we teach rather than do, making people more successful over the long term. Having four TypeScript entries complicates the list. Why do we have four TypeScript entries and not multiple variations for gulp?  Again, I am trying to keep the product consistent and streamlined.  To help close this I suggest we establish a principle which says there is one entry for a task type (e.g. grunt, gulp, npm, etc.). Any variations on how to set up tasks for these should be covered in the documentation. Following this model would keep the list clean (one entry per type) and would also support adding npm to the list, as is being requested."

13973|@chanpod thanks for verifying your project with a newer version of node. Yes, some versions of node have obscure issues with debugging. Whenever you see a problem, it is always a good idea to try an older or a newer version.  Does the crashing b/c of the mongoose module still occurs for your github project and node 5.8?

We performed the testing tasks for different platforms based on the items in `Debugging JavaScript` *(checked off the items in the description of this PR).

13994|"Hi @alexandrudima , do you know if something has changed prior to 0.10.11 about it?   I had an extension [Copy Word in Cursor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.copy-word) that is meant to replace the `Copy` and `Cut` commands when  there is no selection. It automatically selects the word where the cursor is, and copies/cuts to the clipboard, but I just noted that it is not working anymore :cry: . It detects and select the word, but when I call `vscode.commands.executeCommand(""editor.action.clipboardCopyAction"");`, it does not respect the new selection, and the whole line is copied to the clipboard strangely, if I use the `clipboardCutAction` command, it _cuts_ the selected word, but the clipboard is filled with the entire line, again.  I don't know if the commands itself changed, or if I have to do something else after updating the `selection`. The code is basically:  ``` TypeScript   const cursorWordRange = doc.getWordRangeAtPosition(selection.active);   var newSe = new vscode.Selection(cursorWordRange.start.line, cursorWordRange.start.character, cursorWordRange.end.line, cursorWordRange.end.character);   editor.selection = newSe;   vscode.commands.executeCommand(""editor.action.clipboardCutAction"");  ```  Thanks for your help."

13996|"I tried installing a vim plugin for vs code and found it unusable as well; simple bindings didn't work (ie. `yyp`). I understand it's a work in progress. Therefore, I'd like to provide some feedback on what I'd expect out of a vim plugin. :)   Here are the important key bindings for me: - basic commands need to work (`yyp` `ddp` `p` vs. `P` `cc` `C` etc...) - simple searches (`*` to find all instances under cursor and `#` to search in reverse) - finding text with `/` and `?` - quick edits are crucial (`ci""` `di""` `vi""` `va""` `ciw` `daw` `cit` `dit` `ct]` `cf<char>` `de` ...) - marks need to work (`ma` / `'a` and `mA` / `'A`) - command line mode (`:%s/find/replace/g` and `:sp` `:w` `:wq` `:e filename` etc...) - macros (`qa<do stuff here>q`, then `22@a`) - named registers (`""ayi(` then `vi(""ap`) - :+1: for supporting my `~/.vimrc` or `~\_vimrc` configs  Everything I've listed above are very important bindings for me, and I'm assuming most Vim users. I personally use them everyday. They are considered ""standard vim functions"" in my eyes. I develop in MS Windows 90% of the time and use [ViEmu](http://www.viemu.com) in Visual Studio 2015 and SQL Server 2014 all day. it's an absolutely stellar product, and I can't live without it! I did use VsVim for a while and it was great as well. If I remember correctly, it lacked in command line mode for me and had some other small issues with recording macros. I'm sure many of my ailments have since been fixed. Regardless, I currently use ViEmu and have very few complaints.  The biggest problem I've had with all Vim plugins is the way vim bindings work against standard windows shortcuts. For example, `<c-v>` is typically paste, but in vim it's for visual block mode. There are other bindings as well that I always butt heads with like `<c-o>` for traversing jump lists and not ""File Open"", `<c-n>` for word completion and not ""File New"", `<c-y>` for scrolling.. It's a tricky puzzle for sure.   Thanks for creating this case and requesting feedback from all the Vim users. I sure hope to see a solid vim solution for VSCode. In the meantime, I'll continue to use Visual Studio 2015 with ViEmu."

The better fix is to keep the list of paths in memory once you ran the search once and reuse that information.
