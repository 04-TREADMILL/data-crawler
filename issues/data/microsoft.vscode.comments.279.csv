27803|Basic support is there for v1.3.0 using: - <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>insert</kbd> to copy - <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>insert</kbd> to paste  This will be improved in the future with the ability to specify your preference in keybindings.json.
27804|This isn't limited to Unity, there is no special syntax highlighting for e.g. the System namespace either, unless I'm suffering from a misconfiguration of course.  Pretty sure that it is intended this way though, since intellisense and such work fine for Unity or otherwise here, just the highlighting is limited to primitive types, keywords, and depending on the theme method return types and such.
27805|@Tyriar thanks for the quick response!
27806|Upleveling xterm fixed this for the most part, the main issue I see with it currently is https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8219

27808|"@isidorn What about the 'enable extension' thing after you've installed? (Pretty cool feature imho, I'd personally love to see this evolve into enable/disable, without actually uninstalling)  ![vscode_ext](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8385202/16395745/c2abb36c-3cbb-11e6-9ff6-a8c5fe86272c.png)  Quick test on outdated Fedora21:  Something that doesn't work properly is uninstalling an extension. Tried with ""git history"", it just jumped straight back to ""install"" button, but the commands of the extension were still in command palette, just giving error message about missing handler.  It should probably prompt for restart after uninstall I guess."
27809|@bpasero When the command is executed, the command can not find out for which editor it has been called. The extension API returns all active text editors but the preview editor is not one of them.
27810|@dilijev :+1: let me know if there are any more issues with it on tomorrow's Insiders.
27811|You can see a glimpse of what's coming in v1.3.0 in the June test plan: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8222
27812|@Tyriar thanks for the hint - i managed to console log the variables: - PTYSHELL: C:\Windows\SysWOW64\cmd.exe - PTYCWD: c:\Users\Fabian Wohlschläger\Documents\Code\aspnetcore-workshop\MyNewApp  Both paths exist. Does this help to analyse the error?

27815|Great thanks. This is a duplicate of https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7727 due to the `ä`. Pretty sure it's an upstream pty.js/winpty issue.
27816|Last comment in #7540 indicates that the Problems panel should behave the same as the other panels. Reopening since Ctrl+Shift+M still does not toggle visibility like other panels (Output, Debug Console, Terminal).
27817|Nice catch, I can reproduce :smiley:
27818|@Tyriar, thanks, will check that out.
27819|Moving to SASS is a great idea for a variety of reasons, but in this particular instance, it can't actually help us directly.  The challenge is that these colors need to be changed at run-time based on the theme users have selected; this is where CSS custom properties shine.  Except, @bpasero is right that (for now) it's not easy to compute derived colors.  But, there are **two possible options to mitigate this:**  ### CSS blend modes  We can still use the CSS custom property base colors.  Then we can apply CSS blending modes like `mix-blend-mode: soft-light` which will take the opaque color and blend it as if had some alpha.  This is natively supported in the version of Chromium that we use.  ### CSS Level 4 color-mod()  [CSS Level 4 colors](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#modifying-colors) will fix the problem with not being able to derive colors by introducing `color-mod()` function.  This allows you to take a base CSS color and darken/lighten or add alpha.  While I'm not sure if this is currently supported in Chromium, we can use the [css-next](http://cssnext.io/) library, which is comparatively as fast as libsass they say and lets you use CSS 4 syntax today in all browsers.  Odds are that we will be able to pull this dependency out soon since W3C is working on standardizing this right now.
27820|Can we add the `Explorer` panel to this list? `CMD + Shift + E` - Should toggle the Explorer panel's visibility.
27821|"To add to this, I've had this problem with other editors where you would normally want to have tabs replaced by spaces (and enable a setting for the same), but for certain formats where TAB is a specific syntactical requirement, like Makefiles, you need a way to insert the literal TAB character.  Other editors usually have some kind of ""solution"" to this:  Notepad++ has the ability to insert bytes for non-printable characters like TAB (x09) because Ctrl+Shift+[Letter] inserts a byte with the numerical value of the ordinal location of the [Letter] in the alphabet. So Ctrl+Shift+I = \x09 = {TAB}. I remember this particular combination via the coincidental mnemonic ""I for Indent"".  Vim lets you insert verbatim characters with Ctrl+V while in insert mode. (So Ctrl+V followed by the TAB key on the keyboard inserts a \x09.)  I don't feel that either of those is especially user-friendly so I'm not sure either is the right solution for VS Code.  A possibility is to have certain filetypes (Language Modes) always treat the TAB key as a literal TAB even if the user chose to insert spaces instead of tabs in general for indentation in source files, or to have a hotkey insert a literal TAB. (Although, obvious candidates like Ctrl+T and Ctrl+Shift+T are already mapped.) Maybe Ctrl+Shift+I which is unmapped would still make sense for this.  Right now the only solution is to use another editor, copy-paste the TAB, or change the indentation (tabs vs spaces) setting (which is annoying and might leave you in a situation where you are unintentionally inserting literal tabs afterwards)."
27822|@jrieken I would like to discuss the convention of using the alt key to change command behavior sometime.  In the mean time, here are the icons :)  [PreviewOnRightPane_16x.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/336030/PreviewOnRightPane_16x.zip)

27830|"@dbaeumer I'm lucky to have found this Issue - this problem bit me pretty hard.  Perhaps a warning message can be shown in the ""Problems"" pane when a ""virtual project"" is active?  (A record of my problem on SO - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37977444/how-to-make-vs-code-aware-of-globals)  Granted, this was certainly my ""fault"" since my `tsconfig.json` was configured wrong, but my project continued compiling and executing fine (I'm using webpack), so it never occurred to me that my `tsconfig.json` file might be misconfigured.  Just thought I'd provide some feedback in the hopes it can make VS Code a bit better for future noobs like me! :)"

27834|@stevencl   I am more inclined to the 100% width of the search box, and the height is adaptive. Now the search box is too short, and the preparation of the code when you may often need to search for a relatively long code fragment. If it is a 100% width search box, then there is no need to fold(drop down) the buttons.  Sublime Text:  ![Sublime](https://img.alicdn.com/tps/TB1qXraKFXXXXcxXpXXXXXXXXXX-1347-103.png)  ---  By the way, usually the focus of our vision is on the left, especially when full screen writing code, usually we will set up more than 80 characters automatically wrap. So now the search box aligned to the right, I think the user experience is not good.  Anyway I expect the next version can be added to `find all` button.  Thanks!
27835|I'd like to leverage `workbench.action.showEditorsInGroup` for `:tabs` but seems it's still not exposed publicly yet.
27836|Same here...  I was too eager to install ubuntu 16.04...  error: System.IO 4.1.0-rc2-24027 provides a compile-time reference assembly for System.IO on .NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0, **but there is no run-time assembly compatible with ubuntu.16.04-x64.** error: System.Globalization.Calendars 4.0.1-rc2-24027 provides a compile-time reference assembly for System.Globalization.Calendars on .NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0, but there is no run-time assembly compatible with ubuntu.16.04-x64.  really LOVE VSCode, we need support for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
27837|Reproduced this problem with default Chinese IME(Microsoft Pinyin), version 1.2.1 on Windows 10.
27838|Hm, 555 MB should still be ok though. What workspace are you using Code with?
27839|Oh ok, that is indeed a problem...
27840|👍  related: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8185
27841|@bgashler1 looks nice, worth a try 👍
27842|Here's what using `blend-mode: soft-light` looks like with multiple themes.  It works actually remarkably well at responding to theme (very similar to what we have already).  I have this in a pull request coming up in a minute.  ![using-luminosity-blending-for-theme](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11839736/16403834/1157acc2-3cae-11e6-8853-78a301b471c4.gif)
27843|@bgashler1 while this looks nice on mac, I cannot merge this in because on Windows it looks horrible for me. The font is now so light that everything becomes hard to read:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/16403937/85263d66-3cfa-11e6-923e-ab9178c8788a.png)
27844|I wonder why on your screenshot it looks different? I am on Windows 10.
27845|By analyzing the blame information on this pull request, we identified @bpasero and @isidorn to be potential reviewers
27846|@bpasero Do we have a class that says if we're on Mac?  Maybe we only set `font-weight:300` if we're on Mac?
27847|I will close this one and work on a solution that brings in font-weight 300 only on Mac. there it works nicely!
27848|"@isidorn While Steven and I collaborate holistically on evaluating our colors, iconography, etc, I think the change in this PR #8238 may dampen the problem somewhat (below).  You'll notice that the tab well is now the same color as the viewlet which—aside from being more hierarchically correct color-wise—has the benefit of being less confusing with the command palette's input box.  <img width=""784"" alt=""screen shot 2016-06-27 at 9 51 13 pm"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11839736/16404220/da83acec-3cb1-11e6-958b-a8ffbf0abb42.png"">  I'll move this to the backlog for now and we can keep this on our radar."
27849|Still have to push it :)
27850|@isidorn is this fixed with the new viewlet?
27851|I cannot reproduce, we persist folding information and restore it.  @mjohnsonengr do you have steps?
27852|Everyone please report this to https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode  //cc @jrieken
27853|Assuming this is about C#, please report this to https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode
27854|We cannot just throw away the dirty file because it contains user written content. This is to prevent data loss.
27855|@chrmarti can you give more details where in code this happens? would like to reproduce
27856|I disagree, the find options are in tab order and need to be accessible too.
27857|@rebornix editor actions moved into the tabs context menu, there you will find it.
27858|I cannot reproduce, @mohsen1 any more details? video / screenshot maybe?
27859|It's actually not just by selecting. Clicking on the editor won't switch the focus either.   I use [Fish](http://fish.sh/) if that matters.  here is a screencapture: https://gfycat.com/ImpeccableFluidLabradorretriever
27860|👍
27861|Yes this is fixed with the new viewlet, once an extension is uninstalled we do not show the message to restart vscode
27862|@bpasero , I didn't know tabs have context menu previously. It made those commands less discoverable but they still work well.
27863|Ok will do now!  DONE: https://github.com/textmate/sql.tmbundle/pull/15
27864|It is done upstream, but seeing the activity on that bundle.. it might take a while.
27865|I thought this was a bug in that it was only showing me whitespace in certain cases, but realize this is the expected behavior. Undecided about the behavior as I've not yet used it, but might I suggest a better name to indicate what it really does?
27866|@Tyriar can you reproduce?
27867|There is a extension for this called crane.  https://hvy.io/crane https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HvyIndustries.crane  But sure, seeing this feature native in vs code would be awesome.
27868|Yeah we have a UX issue about discoverability.
27869|@bgse enable / disable will come in the future. Can you please create a seperate bug for the issue you just described - thank you.  @shanselman in the latest version of vscode ext install works as following - hope that works for you also ![extinstall](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1926584/16406649/b1589572-3d0f-11e6-8c6b-59aac7d77553.gif)
27870|See https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6759 for the related issue.
27871|@isidorn did you configure to open new tabs to the left maybe?
27872|@bpasero I did, but only after filing this bug. So no.
27873|The tsconfig JSON schema is already fetched from http://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig. See the association here: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/typescript/package.json#L238 We added an additional property `allowJs` which I see is now available.  For the jsconfig schema we used our local version as there was none on the schemastore before. I will update to use the one from schema store.
27874|This issue was moved to Microsoft/TypeScript#9386
27875|@rinogo fully agree. It is a feature request we have on the TS team
27876|This is not yet resolved. The problem was not in the domNode but in the row. The row is null  ![screenshot from 2016-06-28 10 00 13](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/390575/16408096/585b52f4-3d17-11e6-8ac0-a8695835ac2e.png)
27877|@bgashler1 some feedback after trying it out: - can you check if your PR is based on top of master version of tabstitlecontrol.css, I think I did some changes meanwhile - noticed you changed the scroll color, can you say where this applies to? - I am not 100% convinced I like the missing borders between tabs, it almost looks like a bug to me - while I like the background color change, the tab now easily blends into the viewlet to the left, so maybe we need some border there as separation?  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/16408039/0f72dc6a-3d17-11e6-9636-6ff60d8f94ba.png) - a similar issue exists on the other hand with the group actions  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/16408092/4dd815ec-3d17-11e6-9e1f-8fa0b5db9c95.png) - the active tab to the left shows a border which looks a bit weird, almost hanging over nowhere  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/16408504/66660bf8-3d19-11e6-87f7-b3b9a681d186.png)  Otherwise seems to work nicely 👍
27878|It is a VS Code setting. File > Preferences > Workspace Settings.
27879|@yuit In our own version of the jsconfig we updated some of the descriptions of those options that only apply when downlevel compiling. Where can I file a feature request to consider this in http://json.schemastore.org/jsconfig ?
27880|@JostCrow my mistake, pushed a fix :)
27881|@ijat the window updating should happen in any case also when tabs are not enabled. you say you only see this when tabs are enabled?
27882|Ok Thanks!
27883|On the latest insiders build, on windows, I see Ctrl + Shift + M is toggling the visibility.  @gregvanl Can you please check again and reopen if it is not.
27884|Thanks @yisibl. I understand the points you are making about the current find experience.  As you've pointed out, Sublime has a very different user experience for find and find in files. We use the small box for find and a viewlet for find in files so that we minimise the extent to which we interfere with the code that the user is browsing.  In order to accommodate richer find interactions such as the one you are proposing here we need to ensure that we minimise the amount of code we obscure when we draw the find UI. Hence my suggestion above (and the reason why we align the find UI to the right).  So without any major modifications to the current find UI, I would recommend the drop down button to expose the Find All command. That way we incorporate the new functionality without requiring major changes to the overall find UX.
27885|Not critical - assigning to Joao and July so he can decide.
27886|I believe as designed, that extension does not have a license, however some extensions do e.g https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/ms-vscode.wordcount/license  All in all, assigning to july and joao so he can decide if we can improve this. IMHO it is up to the extension to upload the license to the marketplace
27887|But can you also reach out to the marketplace contacts that they could show a good message?
27888|Dup of #8251
27889|Actually the fix is easy and would make it look considerbly better -> june and me
27890|Isn't it better to have support for C# in VSCode natively, rather than to rely on 3rd-party? I mean no dis-respect to Omnisharp, but I think proper synchronization is necessary between dotnet core releases and C# extension releases for VSCode.
27891|Dup of #8251
27892|June to investigate
27893|I think this is designed node behavior that it does not exit in this case. Forwarding to @weinand to decide.
27894|Agree, feature request, july, assinging to joao
27895|@alexandrudima sent an email
27896|Agree, not cruical -> july, joao
27897|@anidotnet   > Isn't it better to have support for C# in VSCode natively, rather than to rely on 3rd-party? I mean no dis-respect to Omnisharp  It is actually not a 3rd-party, OmniSharp is done by a community where also Microsoft developers contribute, pls see the [team page](http://www.omnisharp.net/#team).
27898|@alexandrudima I did the testing and I agree that the find in selection versus prepopulating the find box is now a little inconsistent. I would suggest the following: - if text is selected that spawns more than  one line we still assume that the user wants to find in selection. - if he unchecks the FInd in Selection and didn't type and search text we can repopulate the search field with the selected text as a regular expression.
27899|This is a node bug: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1788 You will see the same behaviour with node-inspector.
27900|@stevencl I can change this but this will cause any operation that involves opening an editor to be noticeably slower (by 250ms). That is why I decided to not push for it for now because I am worried this makes the overall perceived performance slower.
