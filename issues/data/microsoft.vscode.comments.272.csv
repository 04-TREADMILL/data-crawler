27102|"I guess the bug linked by me above, related to the node.js debugger extension, describes the same problem.  I prepared a simple project here for easily testing the ""jump in breakpoints"" via Docker for Windows / Mac.     https://github.com/delfinof/debugging-in-docker  My guess is that via the debugger, visual studio code receives some kind of update to the position of the breakpoints, and thinks they are relative to the ""typescript source"" instead of the ""compiled javascript"".  It is worth nothing that: - it happens only when attached to a remote instance. Attaching to a local running process does not produce any problem - it doesn't seem to be related to path separators, since it happens on Mac debugging Linux too."
27103|@shaneparsons the idea for this setting is to ignore watching folders for file changes that contain resources you do not work with (e.g. do not show in the explorer or search in). Taking out large folders from file watching will have a positive impact on performance.
27104|I would also add that we animate it closed into to the status bar.  This will serve two purposes: 1) Helps users understand that we are not terminating processes; we're just hiding the view 2) Helps users discover that they can drag this back out at any time from he status bar.

27114|@bpasero this was on my laptop that dual boots Ubuntu and Windows.
27115|Is this something we can improve upon? Atom puts it in the status bar for example.
27116|"Yes, I was thinking the same thing: the main question is to know when to populate the input box. This is why I also posted something on #6190. Whatever the workflow is for that is related to this. The basic workflow would be:   1) Check existing commit message. 2) If exists, then load the box with that. 3) If doesn't exist, then check for template, load that.  4) If none, then populate with a default template.  So, I'd like to hear if @sijad has done anything towards the code of that issue. Perhaps it would be better to merge the issues as ""Improve git commit workflow"" or similar."
27117|"@bpasero Exactly, the current insiders implementation changes the old command id use of ""editor"" to be ""editorgroup"" and is a large breaking change.  I don't think we need to make this breaking change. I would leave ""editor"" as is and it refers to the 3 editor windows.  I would keep the term ""file"" and not rename it to ""editor""."
27118|@gregvanl I would appreciate if you could point me to the commands in particular how they should be. there is a list of commands in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6605

27125|"Here's Atom's editor [pane documentation](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/panes)  They call out ""items"" to refer to non-file content in an editor pane: ""Each pane has its own ""items"" or files, which are represented by tabs.""  The rest of the documentation just continues to talk about ""files""."
27126|Most of the features can be implemented as an extension, but here are a couple reasons it might be better to implement this in vscode itself: 1. It uses code injection (#6201) to hide the replaced text, which is not officially supported and has some bugs. 2. Cursor movement still steps through each character of the hidden text. I have not found an ideal hook for overriding cursor movement: I can hook the `'cursorLeft'` command, but there seems to be no way to restore the original behavior, or I can set up keybindings that hook cursor movement keys. Neither of these options play well with potential extensions that change cursor movement behavior or a user's custom keybindings that choose alternatives to e.g. the left key (e.g. the vim extensions). 3. I've tried both `display: none` and `font-size: 0pt` to hide text, and both cause the cursor to disappear when at the left or right edges of the range where such a decoration is applied.  But my preference would be to have a supported way to hide text (e.g. through decorations) that handles cursor movement and cursor visibility properly, and then leave the rest to an extension.
27127|An alternative to ligatures is to use [prettify-symbols-mode](http://emacsredux.com/blog/2014/08/25/a-peek-at-emacs-24-dot-4-prettify-symbols-mode/), which [I've implemented as a plugin](https://github.com/siegebell/vsc-prettify-symbols-mode) for the insider's build of vscode (but note that it is of beta quality right now).

27129|Essentially Atom solves this by calling an entry in a `Pane` an `Item` because it is not necessarily an editor to change the contents inside.
27130|@joaomoreno I actually wonder if this is also something that should go into the tabs widget because it is closely related to animations and timings. I thought about it once and could not come up with a good solution because our tabs are not even width.

27136|@bill-mybiz good call I didn't spend much time on it. I'm not sure with the best practice to access to commit input and change its value.
27137|I'm also facing Issues with `ctrl`+`C` and other simmilar copy-paste shortcuts in the integrated terminal on Windows. I'm not sure what would be the best solution to this issue. Some people would enjoy copying and pasting using the default OS keyboard shortcuts, but it would be difficult to break a current running process (except for OS X). I strongly use this shortcut.  I'd rather remove the shortcut indicator in the right-button-menu for copy/paste/cut to avoid misunderstandings.

27175|I have similar issue that code-insiders does not respect my PATH variable (overrides with `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`). Your code @joaomoreno executes fine for me and it has proper `PATH` variable

27177|"yes, the latest - the one that starts with ""And finally, how about this one?"" :) - in fact both of them works for me"
27178|Thanks for trying it out. Let's wait for @jtsom and @sr105 to confirm.
27179|I get an error for both of those:  ``` SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input     at Object.parse (native)     at <anonymous>:18:22 ```
27180|Duplicate of #7361. We don't support cygwin git, sorry.  We've been using Git for Windows successfully in the team, complete with SSH keys, options, line ending encodings et al. What is the actual issue you get with it?
27181|"Alright, thanks for the patience... can you then show me what you get with this one?  ``` es6 const electron = ""/Applications/Visual Studio Code - Insiders.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron""; const cp = require('child_process'); const env = Object.assign({}, process.env, {     ATOM_SHELL_INTERNAL_RUN_AS_NODE: '1',     ELECTRON_NO_ATTACH_CONSOLE: '1' }); const command = `'${electron}' -p 'JSON.stringify(process.env)'`; const result = cp.spawnSync(process.env.SHELL, ['-ilc', command], {     detached: true,     stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', process.stderr],     env,     encoding: 'utf8' }); const strip = s => s.replace(/[\u001b\u009b][[()#;?]*(?:[0-9]{1,4}(?:;[0-9]{0,4})*)?[0-9A-ORZcf-nqry=><]/g, '').replace(/\u001b\].*?\u0007/g, '');  console.log(strip(result.stdout)); ```"
27182|"Hmmm. So this is a dupe of a ticket that's closed because we've ""just never really looked into it""?  My issue is that I can use _exactly_ the same setup with Cygwin than on Linux without having to sort out the (rather clunky) Git for Windows options and separate management of SSH keys. It's just less friction for someone who has to work routinely on both environments. Personally, I would very much like _not_ to have to use Git for Windows _at all_ and just rely on the Cygwin binaries.  Also, you missed my suggestion of adding a `git.env` setting to set the environment for Git binaries, which is also useful on other platforms. Should I file an issue for that separately?"
27183|If #7361 were open we would close this one the same way. It is a duplicate, in any case.  Apologies for coming out harsh.  Let me expand a bit on _just never really looked into it_. Code already needs to support whichever version of git you have installed in whichever platform you are using it. It is a non-trivial task that gets another complexity fold as soon as we add git _flavours_. We've found that Git for Windows handles the great majority of the tasks users need and I've personally have yet to find a reason that would make me use cygwin instead.  Of course, I can be wrong and I'm definitely interested in someone proving me wrong. That's why I asked about the actual issue you face. If it is really something Git for Windows does not support, of course we'll reconsider our position towards cygwin, and we'll work towards that.
27184|It's all about integration. When you use Cygwin and its userland (bash, CLI tools, SSH, etc.), you don't need an extra terminal emulator like PuTTY, you can use standard Git plugins that rely on Perl/Python etc. seamlessly, and you don't need to set up a copy of your SSH keys anyplace else.   Right now, the current (stunted and incomplete) UNIX userland clone that ships with Git for Windows doesn't provide me those affordances. Also, I can't set GIT_AUTHOR_\* and GIT_COMMITTER_\* on a per-repo basis using Git for Windows - it's just a surreal amount of pain to deal with that kind of thing inside it, when it all works perfectly in Cygwin.  With an environment setting I might not only actually get Cygwin Git to work (I suspect it's just a matter of setting the right HOME and a few more variables) but also have GIT_\* settings set on a per-project basis for me inside VS Code. And this last bit will benefit every other platform, too.
27185|This is a bit unfortunate and a not so common real world case. It happens when: - There are no changes other than conflicting changes - The conflict resolution for **all** changes is to take `A` version  The command line `git` will create an _empty_ commit, since there is nothing to be done on the merge commit. Code will just not let you do a commit since it doesn't support empty commits.  We should maybe make Code aware that a merge is in progress, thus allowing the completion of the merge to follow.
27186|no errors, no output  Why do you need to strip out some of the text from the environment?
27187|Alright, let's keep this open for tracking the support. A PR would be much appreciated as we'll likely not have cycles to look into it any time soon.  Maybe next time I'm in the Lisbon office, I'll ping you and we'll get it working in an afternoon. :wink:
27188|"Great question. [This comment has the answer](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7644#issuecomment-226137884). It's not that I'm stripping from the environment, but from the output of spawning your `SHELL` which spawns `electron`. This may contain ANSI escape sequences.  OK, let's try without the `strip` just to know for sure what is in there:  ``` es6 const electron = ""/Applications/Visual Studio Code - Insiders.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron""; const cp = require('child_process'); const env = Object.assign({}, process.env, {     ATOM_SHELL_INTERNAL_RUN_AS_NODE: '1',     ELECTRON_NO_ATTACH_CONSOLE: '1' }); const command = `'${electron}' -p 'JSON.stringify(process.env)'`; const result = cp.spawnSync(process.env.SHELL, ['-ilc', command], {     detached: true,     stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', process.stderr],     env,     encoding: 'utf8' }); const strip = s => s.replace(/[\u001b\u009b][[()#;?]*(?:[0-9]{1,4}(?:;[0-9]{0,4})*)?[0-9A-ORZcf-nqry=><]/g, '').replace(/\u001b\].*?\u0007/g, '');  console.log(result.stdout); ```"
