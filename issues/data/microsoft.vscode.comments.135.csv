13408|@aeschli @bpasero I didn't want to just go off and do this without first discussing with you.  Now that there is the new json theme capability I think we should have strategy pattern for each theme file format (json, tm and css). The current loading and parsing code would be exactly the same as now but will be encapsulated and easier to test and support for each theme file format.  How's that sound?

13412|I am getting this in Windows 10 with the newest update to vscode.
13413|@isidorn, I updated the PR addressing your feedback, as well as adding some testing.  For testing the existing debug adapters, on top of what is in brackets (which is the stuff that needs to be tested thoroughly), is there a standard list of stuff to test (e.g., list of stuff for breakpoints, list of stuff for step, etc.)?
13414|@bgashler1 That is looking good so far. Just keeps it simple. - The size of the text and radio button look right for people with disabilities. Maybe size could be tailored for preference but default to big so new starters to vs code with disabilities can jump right in. - I think using radio buttons for true and false is spot on because their best for choosing a single option in a list, where as check boxes are best for opt-in opt-out lists.  Be cool to have a search filter to quickly get to each configuration from inside or outside of the settings file, it could also hide non-relevant settings too. Also categorization for things like theme overrides and extension settings would be wonderful.  I've never liked the way ide's have handled their preference gui's. I've always felt removed from the actual environment I'm working in and to top it off I'd always find a crucial area of configuration stuck in a horrible little single line text box. (:cough: :cough: just like (the old) Microsoft Windows Env Path editor in system properties).

If the message is shown in the status bar such as Sublime Text, IntelliJ, Atom Linter, etc., I can know the reason immediately without additional operation, when I am typing.

13417|Hi @santiagohdzb, Now, it seems that IntelliSense indicates some types other than primitive data type and `Object` as `any`. Some types of JavaScript's built-in-object (e.g. `Date`, `RegExp`, etc.) are recognized, but some types (e.g. `Array`, `Map`, etc.) are not. https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3802
13418|delete still not highlighted. Is it intended?
13419|@Tyriar I did some testing, <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd> will work, it does not trigger the same window move behavior in gnome that <kbd>alt</kbd>+click does, <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd> does still trigger the move mode.  Whichever combination you end up going with can we please get those configurable in the `keybindings.json` file?
13420|@felixfbecker   > The benefit is easier discovery of settings. Currently, you have a) the default settings where you can discover what settings are available and b) the actual settings.json. You always have to copy+paste the settings or use IntelliSense. In a UI you can see what settings are available, see what values they have and change them at the same place.  Okay, you make some fair points here.  > I don't get this, there would be an actual UI.  Yeah, what I meant by that is that exchanging text with controls _might_ not be as intuitive as a custom made GUI and _might_ be somewhat limited.  Don't mind me though @bgashler1 did a great job so I'm looking forward to see this in action and try it out. :)  @bgashler1 well done! mate.  Paths might be tricky to determine because there's no convention but maybe you can check whether the key ends with `.path` or `Path` and replace it with a file input instead of a textbox.
13421|@pflannery How about supporting themeing more UI components, like the color of the status bar?
13422|@weinand great I can change the default then :+1:
13423|@pflannery I appreciate your work but we are currently not planning to support theming outside the editor. We might revisit this post GA when we decide our 6 months roadmap and keep you in the loop.

13449|It is neither selecting a 'task' nor a 'build environment'. I still think 'Pick a task template' is the right phrase.  We can't remove Jake since we would not be possible anymore to run the Jake auto detection :-). If we remove Jake we need a 'Auto detect template' entry.
13450|And which TypeScript compile do you want to keep. The one with tsconfig, watch or single file.
13451|Setting to march for discussion
13452|@RANUX this is the design of the TS compiler (tsc and tsserver). As soon as you add a files section only files listed are consider to be part of the project defined by that tsconfig.json file. The other file will be in its own project scope. This is how tsc works. If you think tsc should change that behavior please file an issue here: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/
13453|@egamma I have an issue about letting the user know the outcome of the auto detection. I will move this to you since you 'own' the grunt detection :-) to look into why it fails.
13454|Not sure. This one seems lighter: it's about simply restoring the input when you open quick open, selecting the whole text, such that if you type you'd still get the old behaviour.  You don't even need to detect that focus leaves the workbench. Just store the value of the input every time it changes.
13455|@chrisdias I would create a seperate issue instead of commenting here. Are you done testing this item, I do not see it checked off?
13456|@waderyan are you done testing this item? If yes you forgot to check off the checkbox?
13457|@jokeyrhyme It is fixed in `master`, just never published into a release. The fix will come with the next release.
13458|@jsloyer Where is the code located that tries to access that node module? In the VS code main code base (/src) or is it an extension?
13459|Moving to TS.   What we do in this case is we send a close request of the file in its old location and then an open at the new location. There is now API to signal a move right now. If there is something VSCode can do different to solve the problem, please move back.

13463|Good idea. You could also do some auto detection of tasks based on the script names 'build', 'test'.
13464|"There is an options property which takes a cwd property to specific the current working directory of the command executed.  ``` json         ""command"": ""..."",         ""options"": {             ""cwd"": ""...""         } ```"
13465|Agree on the auto detect. But not for March :-)
13466|will add _ignore_ action such that one won't see this again
13467|@jinyutao Maybe you can add a screenshot? The current indentation strategy is based purely on the indentation of lines, A folding region starts when a line has a smaller indent than one or more following lines, and ends when there is a line with the same or smaller indent.  To be more smart and to, for example, understand code blocks, we will have to go one step further and introduce language agnostic folding regions. We have issue #3422 for this.
13468|@SofianHn #3980 is done. You can test it with the latest nightly build
13469|"In March, there is a new setting `editor.detectIndentation = true|false` that replaces the usage of ""auto"" in `editor.tabSize` and `editor.insertSpaces`.  When `editor.detectIndentation` is true, and the file has sufficient hints (e.g. it is not empty, it contains indented lines), `editor.tabSize` and `editor.insertSpaces` will be overwritten. This allows to cover the new file case by using:  ``` editor.insertSpaces: false, editor.tabSize: 4, editor.detectIndentation: true ```  This will make new files use Tabs@4 and existing files will be scanned to detect their indentation."

13476|@RANUX but in our example you only list typings/meteor/meteor.d.ts in the file section. So if you add another file the meteor typings will not be available in that files and therefore you will not get intellisense in that file for meteor typings.

13487|This might cause some data loss, I prefer we keep it the way it is and make it an explicit user action to get rid of the dirty state that he caused in the buffer.
13488|The mouse gesture dispatching doesn't go through the keybindings rules, but I agree this should be configurable somehow.  Here is where the built-in editor mouse dispatching happens: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/c4b514244e2651117b9990295730265f5b902436/src/vs/editor/browser/view/viewController.ts#L66  There are other places in code, such as the link handler that handle Ctrl+Click programmatically.  It would be a bit tricky, but doable I think, to have the `IMouseDispatchData` go through a rule engine that determines what command to invoke on the editor.  We can easily change the code to do something different in Linux, but implementing a rule engine (that would ultimately solve all problems since it would allow configuration) would be a bit more complicated.
13489|@weinand didn't we discuss that run should not open the console. I have no strong feelings here
13490|+1 on labels, git even supports that such that it would appear as `Theirs` and `Ours` in the UI
13491|No, C drive has 99 GB free and D drive has 848 GB free...
13492|Looking great @bgashler1. When do you expect to get sign off on the design?  I think the technical side of things should be manageable, but as a few people (like @eyalsk) have pointed out - we need to make sure that the JSON translates into a GUI as seamlessly as possible. @felixfbecker's earlier JSON Schema suggestion seems like it would cover this.  My feedback/thoughts: - There could be a Windows-style settings search/filter, where it effectively filters the settings shown as you type. There's a lot of whitespace, but I think that fits with the design of VSCode.. - There's a lot of whitespace. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but could make the GUI quite long - especially as people start using more extensions with their own settings. - Has there been much thought to how extensions would be handled in settings? Would it literally represent the JSON structure? Or would it highlight extension settings vs app settings?
13493|Does a restart help?  I've found [this link](http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/61736-63-unable-execute-file-temporary-directory-setup-aborted) that doesn't explain the root cause but does have a workaround.  It seems to be that your Windows installations are in some strange state.
