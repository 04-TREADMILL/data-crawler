24701|@dbaeumer I don't get TS5009, the build runs successfully for me. I had a colleague repeat the repro steps on his machine and he has the same results as I've written up in the OP.  I don't have `tsc` installed globally, not sure if that makes a difference?
24702|Thanks @Merott for chiming in. I use ⌘K very heavily too.  I would love to take this discussion to a point where it might be possible to detach the default bindings whenever the terminal is in focus (except perhaps one shortcut to focus back on the workbench) and only retain the platform-level shortcuts that deal specifically with the terminal. I'm not sure if that's possible, but I suppose that would be most ideal.
24703|I've just followed the repro steps on another machine (Windows 10, Node 6.2, VSCode 1.1) and got the same results again. Repros consistently for me so far on three machines now.
24704|"I can definitely sympathize, I'm not going to be happy unless I copy and paste in the terminal using <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> for example.  I'm not sure how the chord keybindings work exactly and what can override them, but there are conditions you can attach to keybindings, for example:  ``` { ""key"": ""escape"",                ""command"": ""cancelSelection"",                                      ""when"": ""editorHasSelection && editorTextFocus"" }, ```  A `terminalFocus` value seems like an ideal usage of the `when` property.  You can also [unbind keybindings as of v1.2.0](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/May_2016#_workbench) which is another possible remedy.  So it's not possible right now to bind anything to ⌘K?"
24705|Great :smiley:

24709|OK. Here is is again. Don't know what is going wrong here:  [6282-0.0.1.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/302341/6282-0.0.1.zip)
24710|Github may be a good alternative for synchronize settings, either via personal repo or via a public gist
24711|@egamma I'm sorry. I'm late. And the latest version has no problem.
24712|"Starting from vscode 1.2.0 ""Suppress auto-closing of ' for rust"" works. I think the issue can be closed."
24713|"@prashaantt - I came to Github the log this issue myself, but I found this one 👍  - It shouldn't be necessary to disable all keybindings in terminal. In fact, I wouldn't want that.  This can really be simplified to changing the behaviour of the `⌘K` shortcut, to not initiate chord keybindings if it gets used as a normal shortcut. Then, the user can do this:  ``` js {     ""key"": ""cmd+k"",     ""command"": ""terminal.action.clear"",  // does not exist today     ""when"": ""terminalFocus""              // does not exist today   } ```  With the updated `⌘K` behaviour, the above would work just as you'd expect, and only in the context of the terminal. If you leave out the `when` property, your `⌘K` chord bindings will stop altogether. It's not wise, but it's a choice.  Thanks @Tyriar for reopening the issue. And to answer your question, it seems that as of right now, `⌘K` can't be used as a keyboard shortcut, so the above would not be possible yet."
24714|pushed another change. question remains whether we should go the 'nearest' or 'next' location?
24715|I do have tsc installed globally. Will uninstall and try again.
24716|Yes - it is duplicated but for a reason. That is until recently is was hard to 'undo' a keybinding. We recently added that: #612. The setting is only left to not break existing configurations.
24717|When running vscode and starting the extension _F1 > 6282: Read Contents_ no output happens in the output window of vscode, but in codehelper. CodeHelper lists all files of type _.ts_ und _.js_ contained in my project. The output of the list takes several minutes, after that vscode hangs. Let me know if you need to see the output of codeHelper or if I should run additional test cases.
24718|Well, I reckon most projects use a similar structure with an `out` dir and a `src` dir. So nearest should yield the best experience.  Another approach (at least for the `out` dir example) would be to respect `search.exclude` and `files.exclude` to allow ppl to filter out those types of dirs.  I will test https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/befd6961f3f9e2aed7d1cf0e0d780add1af3f8bb with the next daily.

24722|Actually there's 1 extension supports this, it uses github to sync settings.  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync
24723|what i don't understand is where is VS Code pulling the execution policy from?  if i run powershell.exe -noprofile or ise -noprofile they both show get-executionpolicy as remotesigned. But with powershell set as the default integrated shell based on @be5invis settings (without the executionpolicy switch) it shows as restricted.
24724|@Tyriar Yes, `-l` flag, that's all it needs. Also i won't edit the `.bashrc` but put all changes in `.bash_profile` in order to have compatibility with OSX systems, i have my `.bash_profile` in a repo that saves the changes so that i get similar behaviour in both OSX and Ubuntu, same aliases and OS dependent commands.
24725|@coreh Awesome workaround, how didn't i tough about it?
24726|I agree.  The lack of Emmet full support is one of the main reasons why Code is not my daily driver when it comes to editing.  Perhaps this should have been integrated as an extension like most of the other editors that can use Emmet.
24727|"@jbruettcva I'm just taking a guess here but I think the issue is VSCode is somehow opening a PowerShell instance with all execution policy scopes set to ""Undefined"". If you run the following command within the integrated shell you will see all scopes set to this:  ``` powershell Get-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser Get-ExecutionPolicy -Scope LocalMachine Get-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process  # These below are for GPO enforced execution policies Get-ExecutionPolicy -Scope UserPolicy Get-ExecutionPolicy -Scope MachinePolicy ```  I could be wrong but I am guessing that when all 5 scopes are set to ""Undefined"" then Windows will by default use a ""Restricted"" policy to play it safe. If you set any one of those scopes to something other than ""Undefined"" you will see `Get-ExecutionPolicy` now displaying the same value:  ``` powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned ```  Aside from the ""Process"" scope, all execution policies are stored in the registry. So I can only imagine there might be an issue trying to access those registry keys at the time PowerShell is being launch from VSCode. Generally, when most people setup their execution policy initially, they don't specify a scope, which means by default they are setting the ""LocalMachine"" scope, which should be readable by all.  [Set-ExecutionPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849812.aspx)  **EDIT**  Looking into this further I found that the instance of PowerShell that is getting loaded in the integrated shell is in fact an x86 version of PowerShell. Which is odd since the path to the PowerShell executable we are providing is for the x64 version. My guess is Windows sees that VSCode is an x86 app and automatically runs the x86 PowerShell version. If you run the following you can see for yourself:  ``` powershell $env:PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE ```  Further more if you go to the following location, run the x86 instance of PowerShell and then run the 5 Get commands I listed above you will see the same settings you see inside the integrated shell. So this looks more to be an issue with loading the wrong architecture of PowerShell.  `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`  This of course means that you can go into the x86 version of PowerShell, set your execution policy as you like and then that setting will be present when loading the integrated shell."

24729|To implement virtual horizontal rendering is it needed to rewrite the whole layout system?  There has to be easier ways, I mean, lots of basic text editors have full horizontal text rendering (like gedit) but they also freeze like hell and even more I'd say (I've tested some of them). VS Code Is more likely to just get laggy but it freezes for 2-3 secs in some cases, for example when you try to select text/line (from left to right or from top to bottom).  The thing is I really hate line wrapping, I'm looking for a way to disable wrapping but also to not lag/freeze the editor when I'm adding minified code or changing something inside the minified file.  Is there any way to access that internal option? I wouldn't mind setting it to 300, I just don't want to have wrapping :P
24730|OK I ran it again without extensions but still have the problem. Additionally I have tried to exclude the node_modules folder in the project, but the problem still occurs - after about 5 minutes, the CPU of Electron Helper went up to around 100%.

24737|@weinand Thanks! I'd only ever launched via F5, so I totally missed that.
24738|@felixfbecker and this problem does not occur in the Insiders release from May 30?
24739|@magnasteyr this is good and bad news. The good news is that I now understand why you see the performance problems and why gulp goes crazy. The problem is that in your environment reading the content of a file triggers a file change event in both the code helper which is based on C# and the gulp watch which is based on node watch. The bad news is that I have no idea how to fix this since the tsserver needs to read all ts files belonging to your project.
24740|+1 for adding this functionality and have it configurable (or enabled). This will provide same behavior as in Visual Studio, and will allow you to stay on the keyboard and not use the mouse.

24750|@weinand I was short on time an didn't test with Insiders release. It might be related to 37, but as I stated there it is a major effort to guarantee this at the adapter implementation level, because every connection can produce an event at any time...

24755|:-1: @weinand Thanks for marking the original bug report as `duplicate`. I'm speechless.
24756|Thanks for posting this issue. I reset my user settings, changed the zoom back to 0, and the fontSize to 15 and the icons render perfectly. However the tooltip is still a bit large.   Again if we could set the intellisense fontSize and the tooltip fontSize that would be great. Here is another visual of the tool-tip messing up (even with my new settings).  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6901336/15873564/e0ea5c36-2cc4-11e6-9425-75e3285b4530.png)
24757|A lot of regex implementations have a case-insensitivity flag, and I'm in favor of keeping it. Perhaps the tricky part is that I want case-insensitive by default when I'm doing a substring search, but I want case-sensitivity by default when I do a regex search.  Who would have guessed such a small feature would be so hard to do UX for? :)
24758|"When I change tsconfig.json to:  ``` json {     ""compilerOptions"": {         ""target"": ""es6"",         ""module"": ""commonjs"",         ""outDir"": ""../built"",         ""rootDir"": ""../src""     } } ```  and compile using  ``` .\node_modules\.bin\tsc.cmd -p src ```  I get   ``` error TS5009: Cannot find the common subdirectory path for the input files. error TS6059: File 'C:/Users/dirkb/Projects/mseng/VSCode/Playgrounds/bugs/repro-build-bug/src/other/thing.ts' is not under 'rootDir' 'P:/mseng/VSCode/Playgrounds/bugs/repro-build-bug/src'.

24759|Using tsc version 1.8.10 works without any problem.
24760|I feel it may be related to link detection, since those seem to take their time to appear in the output pane, but I'm sure the timelines attached above will tell the truth.
24761|"Edit: It suddenly seems to be working again (even though prior to posting I tried the reload js and ts project commands), so I'll wait and see.   I'm running into the same issues. It's a mixed es6/typescript react project. Once in awhile, I can have two tsx files side by side, and one will complain about not being able to find the react module, while the other will not (with the exact same syntax `import * as React from ""react"";`).   This is the current iteration of my tsconfig file. The previous iteration had `""files"": [     ""typings/index.d.ts""   ]` instead of the exclude section (I keep monkeying around with it in the hopes that it will work, but at this point, no matter what I seem to do, the issue still manifests).   ``` {   ""compilerOptions"": {     ""target"": ""es5"",     ""sourceMap"": true,     ""allowJs"": true,     ""jsx"": ""react"",     ""moduleResolution"": ""node"",     ""experimentalDecorators"": true   },   ""exclude"": [     ""node_modules"",     ""Scripts/Build""   ] } ```  I don't know if it matters, but VS2015 is typically open in the background."
24762|Yep, TS1.8 works fine for me too. I can only repro the problem with ts@next (it repros with today's nightly build for me).  I can't get a TS5009 however I try, nor would I expect a TS5009 for such a trivial project structure where the two source files clearly share the common root `src/`.  Could you try expanding out the `build` script inside `package.json` to the equivalent long form:  ``` tsc --target es6 --module commonjs --outdir built src/index.ts src/other/thing.ts ```  That repros the same error for me.
24763|I wonder then if this is an initial discoverability problem that once understood never causes any further issues? In order to keep the product lightweight and not overly distracting we always try to solve for distractions not discoverability (in other words, we don't like UI that only serves to advertise the presence of some functionality that once discovered never needs to be advertised again).  One thing that might help but I'm not sure we can do it easily would be to change the tooltips that we have on these buttons to indicate that they are toggles, not a set of radio buttons. So instead of always saying 'Match case (Alt + C)' we might say 'Toggle case sensitivity {on/off} (Alt + C)' depending on the state of the toggle. That might help with identifying these as toggles.  Another option is that we might consider turning case sensitivity on by default whenever the user toggles regex search on. We would need to turn it off whenever the user toggled regex off though. I'm not that keen on this solution though, I get uneasy doing something like this as it could easily get complex.
24764|i was just about to add request for this.  It could just use your Onedrive folder for settings / extensions.  so +1 for this one. I know there sync via github, but built-in sync via onedrive (or other services) would be awesome
24765|"Tooltips could help.  Another thing I thought of: When case-sensitivity is on, case-insensitive regex matches are still highlighted, but in gray instead of color. Maybe you could play with color differences, tooltips, or another visual tag that would let people know ""hey, you're seeing this because you have case-insensitivity turned on""."
24766|Linking this issue in the Roadmap has not been a good idea because if you read it from the first time you will not get a clear idea of the current status ( more than the Milestone). There's still job to be done but the current state is okayish :+1:
24767|I am very sorry to hear you are having issues with VS Code. I wonder if this issue is being caused by an installed extension. Can you try to run VS Code without extensions? From the command line, execute: `code --disable-extensions` and try your steps again to see if it reproduces. If you see it is an issue with the extension, please file it against the extension repository itself.
24768|On further investigation, noticed this might be a save issue, when I save a file it seems like it's not saving then it tries to save again, hence the flickering the only I have seems to stop the flickering is my Control+Z which is undo command, and even though it's undo, when the flickering is happening it will allow the file to be saved.
24769|Yeah, they should summarize issues and then have links to these summaries so people would know the current plan after it was discussed.   Linking to discussions is bad because they tend to be lengthy and people can't get the idea without reading almost everything but dunno maybe it's not possible for them to do it otherwise.
24770|Didn't even think about that.  Makes sense.  Thanks for looking into this.
24771|This may be considered a duplicate of #5239 actually
24772|"When I started reading the release notes for 1.2, the first thing I looked for was _the Tab Feature_. I appreciate that they put the current status there. But I also got confused. At first I thought it landed, than I realized it didn't, but a lot of progress was made. In that case it really feels like that item should be at the bottom of the release notes with a link to the discussion or a milestone (they both prove the progress on the feature) along with a small note saying something like _""Check out the progress towards Tabs implementation""_.  Regardless of this minor thing. Great job on the release. VS Code is a great product with amazing development cycle."

24777|It look like rename is using the css word rule to determine the word at the location. This doesn't work well with structured content inside string on which this rename wants to work.  Maybe the rename support should be able to tell what range is modified?
24778|It makes sense to me that if there is a selection, the rename operation should apply to the entire selection. If there isn't a selection, then the rename should apply to the word that the caret is currently inside of. An even better option (in my opinion) would be to add a new provided named RenameRangeProvider that could be registered to tell VS Code what range to rename given the current selection.
24779|don't want to jinx it, but it seems the 1.2.0 update took care of it all. Haven't seen any warnings and unexpandable <...> variables yet...   Thank you very much, I feel like flying now :+1:

24781|I am seeing my integrated terminal does not honor line breaks... example in notepad: mkdir directory 1[enter] mkdir directory2  copy paste the above into terminal, it will run as one command with line breaks removed: mkdir directory1mkdir directory2  This happens on windows term with both cmd.exe and powershell so I assume it relates to the integrated terminal functionality itself?

24783|"@The-New-Guy yes just using ""poweshell.exe"" will use the 32 bit version. If you have any ideas how to communicate/guide users to use the 64 bit version join in at https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7095"
24784|@danekan can you open a new issue for that and mention your on Windows? It seems to be working find on Linux.
24785|@joaomoreno what are your thoughts on adding this? My main concern is consistency with other settings (it would be unclear when environment variables evaluated).
24786|Closing as duplicate of https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7266, you might be able to create a .bat file and set that are the shell, but not args as of yet.
24787|Closing as duplicate of https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6451  The only shortcut added in 1.2 was toggling the terminal, more are coming in 1.3.
24788|I haven't actually seen this, could you include a screenshot or a gif? I'm assuming you set it to the bash.exe not the git bash executable also?
24789|This should be fixed by https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6838, or it will come after that at least.
24790|sure
24791|"By title area do you mean the part with ""TERMINAL"" or the file name? It would be great if you could make a gif of the flickering."
24792|More info.. it seems when VS Code launches the node app, it doesn't use the system global paths in /etc/profile (which has the Homebrew added /usr/local/lib path)
24793|👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍
24794|I think I'm having similar problems, if this is unrelated then I'm happy to open a new issue. The app is not crashing, but I'm getting close to 115% CPU from Electron Helper, causing the app to become unresponsive, and close to crashing within minutes. This is the first time I've ever had a problem with VSCode.   I'm getting the same behaviour after disabling extensions and restarting my Mac. I'm using V1.2.0 on MacOSX 10.11.3. Please let me know if there is anything I can provide, or do, to help debug further.
24795|Attached a screenshot. Even though I have pressed mouse button to create a break point - it is not visually shown.  ![image001](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1841838/15871021/c1620a70-2cf2-11e6-8da7-5f0b842e3355.png)
24796|Duplicate of https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6451
24797|VSCode just updated to 1.3.0-insider. Recent files seems to be gone. Is there a way to do that now?
24798|Not possible right now, interesting idea though
24799|a built-in sync via onedrive could be really great.
24800|Duplicate of https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6455, coming in 1.3.0
