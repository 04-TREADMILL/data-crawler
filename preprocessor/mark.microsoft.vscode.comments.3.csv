203|+1 this is on our backlog. however you will not be able to run tests without having a windowing system because in order to provide the VS Code APIs for the tests we still need to open a window.|0
204|@tomlarkworthy for this to work you will need to set the `typescript.tsdk` property (in preferences) to a 1.7 TS version. Are you doing that?|0

239|"That's interesting. After installing the new version on **Windows 10** with a 4k 28"" screen set to 175% scaling, I had the impression that the text rendering got **better** than with the 0.9.1 release (which was still slightly more blurry than rendering in native apps like normal Visual Studio or Sublime)."|0
240|@alefragnani one more question, is there a way to move the cursor?  Say for the sample code you posted:  ```     // current editor     const editor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;      // check if there is no selection     if (editor.selection.isEmpty) {       // the Position object gives you the line and character where the cursor is       const position = editor.selection.active;        // move cursor to this new position?       var newPosition = position.with(position.line, 0);     } ```|0

242|I don't think this is supported. You can, though, define a new command in an extension which simply calls two other commands. You can then assign a keybinding to that command.|0,

253|"To those experiencing font blurriness, this is an issue I have with all chromium-based apps on Windows 8.1 (and will likely never be fixed). A workaround is to add the `--force-device-scale-factor=1` argument when launching vscode. The whole editor will then be very small, so you'll need to adjust the `""editor.fontSize""` user setting (I have it on 18) to make your code more readable.  I haven't found a way to adjust the size of UI-elements as well; vscode doesn't seem to have custom app theming or css like Atom, but for me the interface is still readable, though for a very high-dpi screen it might not be."|0
